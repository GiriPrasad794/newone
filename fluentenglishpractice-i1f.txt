Hello lovely learners. Welcome back to
Fluent English Practice. I'm Sara
and I am Alex. We are so happy you are
here today. We have a fun and very
useful lesson for you.
Yes. In today's video, we will practice
talking about daily routines in English.
But not just any practice. We will use
our special method rivers roll English
practice. This means you will listen
first, repeat and finally explain the
phrases to someone else. Teaching is the
best way to remember.
So keep listening until the end because
we will explain every key phrase for
you. Are you ready?
Let's get started.
Hey, John. What time do you usually get
up in the morning?
Hi, Emma. I usually wake up around 6:30
a.m. What about you?
I get up a bit later at 7:00. Not too
early, not too late.
That's a good time. What's the first
thing you do when you wake up?
First, I turn off my alarm, stretch my
arms, and open the window. Fresh air
wakes me up.
Nice. I go to the bathroom to wash my
face right after getting out of bed.
I do that, too. Then I brush my teeth
and take a shower.
Same here. After my shower, I put on my
clothes. Choosing what to wear is always
the hardest part.
I usually wear something simple, jeans
and a t-shirt. What do you have for
breakfast?
I like eggs and toast with a big cup of
coffee.
That sounds good. I eat cereal with milk
and sometimes I drink orange juice.
Breakfast is important. After eating, I
check my phone and read some news.
I also check my messages before leaving
home.
Going to work.
So, Emma, how do you usually get to
work?
I take the bus most days. On the bus, I
listen to music or an English podcast.
That's smart. I walk to work because my
office is only 10 minutes away.
Walking is healthy. When you arrive,
what's the first thing you do?
I greet my co-workers, then turn on my
computer and start checking my emails.
I make a cup of tea before starting my
tasks. It helps me focus.
Lunchtime and afternoon.
What time do you normally have lunch,
John?
around 12:30, but sometimes later if I'm
busy.
I try not to skip lunch because it gives
me energy. What do you usually eat?
I often bring food from home like a
sandwich, some fruit, and water.
That's healthy. I usually buy something
simple, maybe rice with chicken.
Do you eat alone or with colleagues?
I eat with co-workers. We chat and relax
together.
After lunch, I sometimes take a short
walk outside. It feels good to move.
Fresh air helps. Then I return to work
and continue my tasks.
Evening after work.
What time do you finish work?
Usually at 5:00 p.m. you
same here. After finishing, I shut down
my computer and tidy my desk.
Good habit. I take the bus home and
sometimes stop at a store to buy
groceries.
I also shop for bread, fruit, or eggs on
my way home.
When I get home, I change into
comfortable clothes and rest.
Me, too. I like to sit on the sofa and
just relax for a while.
Evening activities.
Emma, what do you usually do in the
evening?
I relax by watching a show or reading a
book. You
I sometimes play games or watch videos
online.
Do you cook dinner at home?
Sometimes I cook pasta. If I'm tired, I
order food.
I enjoy cooking. It helps me unwind
after a long day.
After dinner, I wash the dishes. I don't
like leaving them overnight.
Same here. Later, I call my parents or
chat with friends online.
That's nice. I sometimes study English
or watch a movie with subtitles.
Bedtime routine.
What time do you usually go to bed?
Around 10:30. I try not to sleep too
late.
I go to bed around 11:00. Before that, I
wash my face and brush my teeth.
I do the same. Then I change into my
pajamas and sometimes read a book.
Do you use your phone before bed?
Only a little. I prefer listening to
calm music.
Good choice. Using the phone too much
makes it harder to sleep.
Great job listening to Emma and John.
Now, let's explain some of the phrases
they used.
First, wake up means your eyes open and
you stop sleeping. Get up means you
actually leave the bed.
Brush my teeth is what you do with a
toothbrush to clean your teeth.
Take a shower means washing your body
under running water.
Pack my bag means you put your things
into a bag before leaving home. Head to
work means you start going to your job.
Grab something simple to wear means you
choose clothes quickly without much
thought.
Entidy my desk means you clean and
organize your work table.
Now it's time for reverse roll English
practice. Repeat the phrases aloud, then
explain them to a friend or even to
yourself. Teaching the words will make
you remember better.
Let's go through the whole phrases used
in daily routine.
I wake up at 7. I wash my face. I brush
my teeth. I eat breakfast.
I leave the house. I take the bus to
work. I listen to music on the way. I
greet my co-workers.
I check my emails.
I start working. I eat lunch at 12:30.
I bring food from home. I take a short
walk. I continue working. I finish work
at 5. I take the bus home. I buy
groceries.
I rest when I get home. I watch a show
in the evening. I cook dinner. I wash
the dishes. I call my parents. I study
English at night. I go to bed at 10:30.
I brush my teeth before bed. I wear
pajamas.
I read or listen to music. I turn off
the lights.
Amazing. You can now describe your daily
routine in clear English.

Nice to meet you, Daniel. I'm Lena.
Welcome to the office.
Thank you. I'm really happy to be here.

That's good to hear. Everyone has been
very kind so far.
Do you live near the office?

That's so convenient.
Yeah, I don't like long commutes.
Same here. Do you drink coffee
all the time? I needed to start my day.
Me, too. Let's grab a coffee during
break.
Sounds good. I'd love that.
You'll get used to the office quickly.
If you need help, just ask.
Thank you, Lena. You've been very
helpful.
No problem. We are a team now.
Looking forward to working with you.
Same here, Daniel. Let's do great work
together
at office coffee break. Weekend plans.
So, Daniel, any plans for the weekend?
Hm. Not much yet. Maybe just relax. What
about you?
I'm going to visit my parents on
Saturday.
That sounds nice. Do they live far?
No, just an hour away. I go there often.
That's great. Family time is the best.
Yes, I love it. What do you usually do
on weekends?
Sometimes I go hiking. Sometimes I just
sleep in.
Sleep is important too. I like to read
or watch movies.
Oh, what kind of movies do you like?
Mostly comedies and dramas. You
I love action and sci-fi, but I enjoy
funny movies, too.
Do you ever cook on weekends?
Yes, I try new recipes on Sunday.
Nice. I usually bake something sweet.
Maybe one day you can bring cookies to
work.
Sure. Only if you bring your famous
lunch too.

friend.

I hope you enjoy this video.
Alex, do you remember your first day
here?
Oh, yes. I was nervous, but everyone was
kind.
Same here. Do you remember how you
introduced yourself?
I said, "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a new graphic
designer. Simple and clear.
That's a good one. I usually say,
"Hello, I'm Sara. I work in the content
team."
Very professional. It helps people
understand your role.
Exactly. What if you meet someone
outside the company?
I might say, "Hi, I'm Alex. I work in
marketing at a media company."
That's useful. It gives more detail.
How about you? What do you say at events
or parties?
I say, "Hi, I'm Sara. I'm a writer. I
create scripts and videos."
Nice. That sounds interesting and
friendly.
Thanks. I think introductions should be
short but clear.
I agree. Start with your name and what
you do
and maybe add something fun like a
hobby.
True. Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a designer and I
love photography.
That makes you more memorable.
Exactly. People like it when you show
personality.
So, what's the best way to introduce
yourself at work?
Something like, "Hi, I'm Alex. I just
joined the design team. Nice to meet
you."
Perfect. Friendly and confident.
And always smile.
Yes, a smile is the best first
impression.
Should we practice some examples?
Sure, I'll go first. Hi, I'm Sara. I'm
new here. I work in the content team.
Nice to meet you.
Hi, Sara. I'm Alex. I work in marketing.
Welcome aboard.
That was good.
And that's how you can introduce
yourself at work or anywhere else.
Yes, it's simple. Say your name, what
you do, and maybe add something
interesting about yourself.
We hope today's conversation helped you
learn how to do it with confidence.
