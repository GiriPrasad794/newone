Proactive English Practice.
Hello everyone. In this English episode,
we will focus on greetings and
introductions.
These are the first words you use when
meeting someone new. So, it's very
important to learn them well. Today,
we'll hear five conversations showing
different ways to greet and introduce
people. If you have a favorite way to
say hello in English, please comment
below. Let's start.
[Music]
Conversation one, meeting for the first
time at a language exchange.
Hi, how are you doing today?
I'm doing well, thank you. How about
you?
I'm good, too. I don't think we've met
before. I'm Alex.
Oh, nice to meet you, Alex. I'm Maria.
Are you here for the language exchange,
too?
Yes, I am. This is my first time coming
to one of these events.
What about you?
I've been coming here for a few months
now. It's really great for practicing
English. Where are you from originally?
I'm from Brazil, but I moved here 6
months ago to study.
And you?
That's interesting. I'm from South
Korea. I came here for work about a year
ago.
Wow. So, we're both learning English.
What do you do for work, if you don't
mind me asking?
Not at all. I work in graphic design.
How about you? What are you studying?
I'm studying computer science at the
university. It's challenging, but I
really enjoy it.
That sounds fascinating.
Well, I'm really glad we met today,
Alex.
Me, too, Maria. It's so nice to meet
someone friendly here.
Take a pause here.
Did you notice how they used both formal
and informal greetings?
How are you doing? is more casual while
nice to meet you is polite and works in
both formal and informal situations.
This helps make a good first impression.
Now, let's continue with more
conversations.
[Music]
Conversation two, introducing two
friends.
Hey, Tom. Perfect timing. I'd like you
to meet my friend Lisa. Lisa, this is
Tom.
Hi, Tom. Nice to meet you.
Hello, Lisa. It's great to meet you,
too. Anna has told me a lot about you.
Oh, really? All good things, I hope.
Definitely. She mentioned you're a
teacher. What grade do you teach?
I teach fifth grade at the elementary
school downtown.
Anna told me you work in marketing,
right?
That's right. I work for a digital
marketing company. It's really
interesting work.
You two have a lot in common, actually.
You both love traveling.
Oh, that's wonderful. Where's your
favorite place you visited, Tom?
I'd have to say Japan. The culture and
food were amazing.
How about you?
I absolutely loved Italy. The art and
history were incredible.
See, I knew you two would get along
great.
Well, Lisa, it was really nice meeting
you. Maybe we can all hang out sometime.
I'd love that. Here, let me give you my
number.
This is great. I'm so happy I could
introduce you, too.
[Music]
Conversation three, meeting an old
acquaintance.
Oh my goodness, Patrick. Is that really
you,
Anna? Wow, what a surprise. How have you
been? It's been so long.
I've been great. I can't believe it's
been what, 3 years since we worked
together?
Something like that. You look wonderful.
How's life treating you?
Thank you. Life's been good. I actually
got promoted last year and I moved to a
new apartment.
What about you? What have you been up
to?
That's fantastic news about the
promotion. I've been doing well, too.
I changed jobs about 2 years ago, and
I'm much happier now.
Oh, that's wonderful to hear. Are you
still in marketing? Actually, no. I
switched to teaching. It was a big
change, but I love it. I teach high
school English now.
Patrick, that's amazing. I always
thought you'd be a great teacher.
You were so patient with everyone at our
old job.
That's very kind of you to say. So, tell
me, are you still with the same company?
Yes, but I'm in a completely different
department now.
I'm in human resources and I really
enjoy it.
That suits you perfectly. Well, it's
been so wonderful running into you like
this.
I know. We should definitely keep in
touch this time.
Here, let me give you my number.
Absolutely. It's so good to see you
again, Anna.
[Music]
Conversation four, formal introduction
at work.
Good morning. You must be Jennifer, our
new marketing assistant.
Good morning. Yes, I'm Jennifer Smith.
It's my first day here.
Welcome to our company. I'm Mr. Davis,
the marketing director.
Thank you so much, Mr. Davis, I'm really
excited to be here.
That's wonderful to hear. How was your
first impression of the office?
Everything looks very modern and
organized. I love the open workspace
design.
I'm glad you like it. We redesigned it
last year to encourage collaboration.
Where did you work before joining us?
I worked at a smaller marketing firm
downtown for 2 years.
This opportunity seemed perfect for my
career growth.
Excellent. What attracted you most to
our company specifically?
Your company's reputation for innovation
and the team oriented culture really
appealed to me.
That's exactly what we strive for. Are
you ready for your first day or do you
have any questions?
I'm ready to start. I did prepare over
the weekend by reading about our current
campaigns.
Very impressive.
That shows great initiative.
Let me show you to your desk and
introduce you to your team.
Thank you so much, Mr. Davis. I really
appreciate how welcoming everyone has
been.
You're very welcome, Jennifer.
We're excited to see what fresh ideas
you'll bring to our team.
Learning note.
Notice how in formal work situations, we
often use titles like Mr. and Ms. with
last names and phrases like, "Thank you
so much." Show politeness and respect.
Conversation
five. Meeting someone new at a coffee
shop.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
No, please sit down. I'm waiting for my
friend, but she's running late.
Thank you. I'm David, by the way.
Nice to meet you, David. I'm Emma. Are
you from around here?
Actually, I just moved here last week
from Seattle. Still getting to know the
area.
Oh, welcome to the neighborhood.
That's quite a big move. What brought
you here?
I got a new job at the tech company
downtown.
How long have you lived here?
About 3 years now. I moved here after
college and fell in love with the city.
That's great. Any recommendations for
good places to visit or eat?
Oh, yes. There's an amazing Italian
restaurant just two blocks from here,
and the park nearby is perfect for
jogging.
That sounds perfect.
I love Italian food, and I've been
looking for a good place to exercise.
You'll love both then.
The restaurant is called Marcos and the
park has a beautiful lake.
Thanks for the tips. It's so nice to
meet friendly people like you in a new
city.
You're very welcome.
I remember how hard it was when I first
moved here. So, I'm happy to help.
I really appreciate that, Emma. Maybe
I'll see you around the neighborhood.
I hope so. And good luck with your new
job, David.

The lady said, "Turn left here."
Then walk three blocks straight.
I see it now. There's the sign.

hard,
but we did it together.
True. We're a good team.

Let me try to coast there.
Okay, I'll keep my fingers crossed.
We made it just barely.
That was close.
Never again. I'll always check.
Good plan.
Conversation number 19.
All the lights just went out.
The whole neighborhood is dark.

but the doors are locked.

Conversation number 22.
I want to make dinner tonight.
That's new. What are you making?

Do you know how?
Not really. Can you help me?
Sure. First, boil some water.

Fill the pot halfway.
Like this. Is this enough?

Just a little. One spoon.
This is harder than I thought.
You're doing fine. Keep going.

My lips are sealed.
She's going to be so surprised.
She'll love it.

I'm thinking about getting a pet.
Really? What kind?
Maybe a dog or cat.
Dogs need lots of exercise.
I know. I jog every morning.
That's perfect, then.
But cats are easier to care for.

I can't decide.
Visit the animal shelter first.
Good idea. Want to come with me?
I'd love to. When?
How about this weekend?
It's a date.

friendship.
I'm excited for your new adventure.
Conversation number 26.
I want to try something new.
Like what?
Maybe painting or photography.
Both sound fun. Which interests you
more?
I love taking pictures.
Photography it is. Then
but cameras are expensive.
Start with your phone camera.
Really? Is that good enough?
Modern phones take amazing photos.
Will you teach me some tricks?
Sure. Let's start this weekend.
