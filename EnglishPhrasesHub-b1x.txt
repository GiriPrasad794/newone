Hi there. My name is Emma and today I
want to tell you a little story.
It's the story of how I learned English.
I was not born in an Englishspeaking
country.
At first, I didn't know many words. I
was shy. I was afraid to make mistakes.
But now I can speak English with people
around the world and I want to help you
do the same.
How did I do it? I practiced every day.
Not for hours,
just a little bit each day. step by
step.
In this video, I will tell you what I
did, the small things that helped me,
the daily habits I used to learn and
speak better English.
Are you ready? Let's begin.
When I started learning English, I
didn't know where to begin.
There were so many words, so many rules.
I felt a little lost.
So, I made a simple plan, a daily
routine. I told myself, Emma, just
practice English every day. Even for 15
minutes, that's enough.
And that's what I did. Every morning
after breakfast, I sat down with my tea
and I studied. Sometimes I read.
Sometimes I listened to a podcast.
Sometimes I learned new words, but I did
something in English every single day. I
also wrote small goals in my notebook,
like learn five new words,
watch one video in English, write three
sentences.
These goals were easy and when I
finished them, I felt happy. I felt
proud and I wanted to keep going. So if
you want to learn English, too, start
with one simple habit. Pick a time,
morning, evening, lunchtime, and do one
English thing every day.
That's how my journey began.
One big change for me was listening.
I started listening to English every
day.
Not just in class, but while I was doing
other things.
In the morning, I listened to a podcast.
While cooking, I played English music.
While walking,
I listened to short stories.
At first, I didn't understand
everything.
sometimes only 30%.
But that's okay.
I didn't stop. I listened again and
again.
Slowly, my ears got better. I started to
hear more words.
I understood more.
Listening helped me speak better, too,
because I heard how real English sounds.
Now listening is part of my day, like
brushing my teeth or drinking tea.
It's a simple habit, but very powerful.
After I started listening every day, I
learned something new.
It's called shadowing.
Shadowing means you listen to someone
speaking English and you repeat the same
words at the same time or just after
like a shadow.
So I listened to short audio or videos.
Then I repeated what I heard.
For example,
I heard I want to learn English.
Then I said, "I want to learn English."
I didn't stop. I didn't translate. I
just copied the sound, the speed, the
voice.
At first it was hard, but after some
days it felt easier.
My mouth moved faster. My pronunciation
was better. I felt more confident.
I did this for just five minutes a day
and it really helped me speak better.
One day I asked myself,
can I think in English?
At first it was difficult.
I always translated in my head from my
language to English.
That made me slow.
So I started small,
just little thoughts in English.
When I woke up, I said in my mind, "It's
morning.
I'm tired.
I want coffee."
During the day, I thought, "The sky is
blue.
I have a meeting. This food is good.
These were small sentences,
but they helped my brain think in
English.
No more translation.
Later, I said the thoughts out loud,
quietly,
like a whisper.
It was like talking to myself in
English.
It felt strange at first, but soon it
became a habit and it really helped me
speak faster and more naturally.
Another thing that helped me was reading
aloud.
Reading silently is good, but reading
aloud is even better.
When I read aloud, my mouth, my tongue,
and my brain work together.
I started with easy books,
children's stories,
short dialogues from videos or English
stories for beginners.
I read slowly.
I tried to say every word clearly.
Then I read the same text again, a
little faster.
Then again with more feeling like an
actor in a movie.
This helped my pronunciation.
It made my speaking smoother and I felt
more confident when I spoke to people.
Reading aloud was like exercise for my
mouth. The more I did it, the stronger
my English became.
I didn't just study English. I used
English in my real life. I made small
changes in my day.
First, I changed my phone to English.
Every time I looked at my phone, I saw
English words like settings, download,
delete. I didn't study these words. I
just saw them many times and I
remembered them.
Next, I started a short diary.
Every night I wrote three sentences
about my day. For example, today I went
to work. I was very tired. I watched an
English video. I also recorded a one
minute voice message every day. I spoke
about my day, my plans, or my feelings.
I listened to my voice and I learned
from my mistakes.
I joined an online group for English
learners. We sent short messages, voice
notes, and questions to each other.
Sometimes I watched short English videos
and repeated the sentences I heard.
These small actions made English part of
my life. It was not homework anymore. It
became a habit and it felt natural to
use English every day.
So this is how I learned English. I
listened every day. I practiced
shadowing.
I thought in English. I read aloud.
And I used English in my real life.
I didn't wait for the perfect time. I
didn't need to be perfect. I just
practiced a little every day. You can do
the same. You don't need to live in
London. You don't need a teacher every
day.
Start small.
Five or 10 minutes is enough.
Listen, speak, read, write, and make
English part of your day.
Step by step, your English will grow.
You will feel more confident.
And one day, you will say, "I speak
English.
I believe you can do it. So start today.
Hello everyone,
my name is Emma.
Today I will tell you about my daily
routine.
I will speak slowly and clearly so you
can understand me easily.
You will learn useful words and phrases
for daily life.
This video is a good way to practice
your English listening and speaking. Are
you ready? Let's start.
I usually wake up at 7:00 in the
morning. My alarm rings and I turn it
off.
Sometimes I want to sleep more, but I
have to get up.
I sit on my bed for a minute and stretch
my arms.
Then I stand up and go to the bathroom.
In the bathroom, I brush my teeth. I
wash my face with cold water.
It helps me wake up.
I look in the mirror and smile.
Sometimes I take a shower if I have
time.
After that, I go to the kitchen. I make
my breakfast.
I usually eat toast with butter and
eggs.
Sometimes I eat cereal or fruit.
I always drink a hot cup of tea.
I like green tea in the morning. It
helps me feel calm and ready for the
day.
While I eat, I listen to music or check
my phone. I like to read messages or the
weather for the day.
After breakfast, I go back to my room. I
choose what to wear. I usually wear
jeans and a simple shirt. If it's cold,
I wear a sweater, too.
Then I brush my hair and get ready.
I check my bag. I make sure I have my
phone, keys, and wallet.
Finally, I put on my shoes and leave the
house. I'm ready to start my day. After
I leave the house, I walk to the bus
stop. The bus stop is near my home, just
a fiveinut walk.
I see other people waiting too.
Everyone is going to work or school.
I usually take the bus to work. The ride
takes about 20 minutes.
The bus is sometimes full, but I usually
find a seat.
I sit by the window and watch the city.
Sometimes I listen to music or a
podcast.
Sometimes I check my phone or just
relax.
When I arrive at work, I walk into the
office building.
I say good morning to the security
guard.
I take the elevator to the third floor.
That's where my office is.
I start work at 9:00.
I work in a small office with nice
people.
I sit at my desk and turn on my
computer.
First, I check my emails.
Then, I look at my schedule for the day.
My job is busy, but I enjoy it. I write
reports,
send emails, and talk to clients.
I also have short meetings with my
co-workers.
We work together and help each other.
In the morning, I work for a few hours.
At 12:30, I take a lunch break.
I go to the kitchen or the breakroom.
I usually bring lunch from home.
I like sandwiches, fruit, or rice with
vegetables.
Sometimes I go outside and buy something
small like a salad or a sandwich.
I eat lunch with my co-workers.
We talk about the weather, movies, or
weekend plans.
It's a nice time to relax and laugh a
little.
After lunch, I feel better and more
focused.
I drink some water or have a cup of tea.
Then I go back to my desk and continue
my work.
I usually finish work at 5:00 in the
evening.
I turn off my computer, pack my bag, and
say goodbye to my co-workers.
I feel tired, but also happy that I
finished my work.
I take the elevator down and leave the
office building.
Outside, the city feels a little
quieter. I walk to the bus stop and wait
for my bus.
The bus ride home takes about 20
minutes. On the way, I sometimes look
out the window and think about my day.
Sometimes I listen to music or I just
close my eyes and rest.
When I get home, I take off my shoes and
hang my bag near the door. Then I change
into comfortable clothes, usually
sweatpants and a soft hoodie.
I feel more relaxed when I'm in my home
clothes.
I go to the living room and sit on the
sofa. I rest for a little while, maybe
10 or 15 minutes. I stretch my legs,
take a deep breath, and enjoy the quiet.
Sometimes I turn on the TV and watch a
short show.
Other times, I read a few pages of a
book. If I'm feeling tired, I just sit
in silence.
Around 7:00,
I go to the kitchen and start making
dinner.
I usually cook something easy like pasta
with sauce, rice, and vegetables, or a
salad with bread. I like to play soft
music while I cook.
Cooking helps me feel calm.
When dinner is ready, I sit at the table
and eat slowly.
I don't look at my phone. I try to enjoy
the food and the moment.
After I finish, I wash the dishes and
clean the kitchen. I like to keep things
tidy. It helps me relax more.
After dinner, I have some free time.
Sometimes I watch a movie or a series.
Sometimes I call a friend or talk with
my family.
Other times I write in my journal or
just listen to music.
My evenings are simple and quiet. I like
having time for myself after a long day.
It's my time to rest, think, and enjoy
the little things.
Around 9:30 or 10:00,
I start getting ready for bed. I go to
the bathroom first. I brush my teeth
slowly and carefully.
Then I wash my face with warm water. It
feels nice after a long day. Sometimes I
use a little face cream. It helps my
skin feel soft.
After that, I go back to my room and
change into my pajamas.
My pajamas are soft and warm. Light blue
pants and a cozy t-shirt. I fold my
clothes from the day and put them away.
I like to keep my room tidy before
sleeping. A clean space helps me sleep
better.
Then I turn off the bright lights and
switch on a small lamp next to my bed. I
close the curtains and open the window a
little if the air is fresh. My room
becomes very quiet and calm. I love this
quiet time. I sit on my bed and pick up
a book. I like to read a few pages
before I sleep. Sometimes I read
stories.
Sometimes I read something that teaches
me new things. Reading helps my mind
relax and slow down.
After reading, I put the book back on my
bedside table. Then I sit for a moment
and think about my day. I ask myself,
what did I do well today? Did something
make me happy? What can I do better
tomorrow? Just thinking quietly makes me
feel calm.
Around 10:30, I turn off the lamp. The
room is dark and peaceful. I lie down in
bed and pull the blanket over me. I
close my eyes and take a deep breath. I
feel thankful for the day. Even if it
was busy or not perfect, I know tomorrow
is a new chance. I smile a little and
say to myself, "Good night, Emma." And
then I go to sleep.
Hi there. Is this seat taken?
Hi. No, it's free. You can sit here.
Thanks. I'm Jack, by the way.
Nice to meet you, Jack. I'm Emma.
Nice to meet you, too, Emma. Are you
from around here?
Yes, I live nearby. What about you?
I just moved here last week. Still
learning my way around.
Oh, welcome. How do you like it so far?
It's nice. Quiet and friendly. People
seem kind.
That's true. It's a peaceful place.
Do you come to this park often?
Yes, sometimes in the evening. I like
walking here.
That's cool. I might come more often
now.
You should. It's a great spot to relax.
So, Emma, what do you do?
I'm a teacher. I work at the local
school. You
I work in it. I do computer stuff from
home.
That's interesting. It must be nice to
work from home.
Yes, but sometimes it's a little quiet.
I miss talking to people.
Well, now you've met someone.
That's true. Thanks for the chat.
So, Jack, you said you just moved here.
Yes, I moved here yesterday from another
city.
Oh, I see. Was it a big move?
Yes, a little. I had to pack many
things, but I like it here.
That's good. Do you live alone?
Yes, just me. My family lives far away.
Same here. My parents live in another
town.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes. One younger sister. She's in
college now.
Nice. I have an older brother. He works
in a hospital.
Wow, that's great. Is he a doctor?
No, he's a nurse. He likes helping
people.
That's so kind. It's nice talking to
you, Jack.
Thanks, Emma. You're very friendly.
Would you like to exchange numbers?
Maybe we can meet again.
Sure, that would be nice.
Here you go. This is my number.
Got it. I'll send you a message.
Great. Talk to you soon, Jack.
See you, Emma. Have a good evening.
Hi. The line is a bit long today, huh?
Yeah, it really is. I guess a lot of
people want coffee today.
Maybe because it's Friday. People want a
break after work.
True. I feel the same. I need something
warm and sweet.
Me, too. I always get a drink before
going home.
It helps me relax.
That sounds nice. Do you come here
often?
Not every day, but maybe once or twice a
week. The drinks are good here.
This is my first time. My friend told me
about this cafe.
Oh, welcome then. What do you usually
drink? Hm. I like cappuccino,
but today I want to try something new.
You should try the vanilla latte. It's
not too strong and it's a bit sweet.
That sounds perfect. I think I'll try
that.
Great choice. And the cookies are also
really good.
I love cookies.
Maybe I'll get one, too.
They have chocolate chip, oatmeal, and
peanut butter.
Chocolate chip is my favorite. Easy
choice.
Same here.
By the way, I'm Jack.
Nice to meet you, Jack. I'm Emma.
Nice to meet you, too, Emma.
Do you live nearby?
Yeah, just a short walk from here. What
about you?
I live a few blocks away, not far.
That's cool. Maybe I'll see you here
again.
Sure. I usually come in the evenings.
Oh, looks like it's my turn to order.
Okay, enjoy your coffee.
Thanks. You, too, Emma.
Hi. Excuse me. Is this the marketing
department?
Yes, it is. Are you new here?
Yes. Today is my first day. My name is
Jack.
Hi, Jack. Nice to meet you. I'm Emma.
Nice to meet you, too, Emma. This is a
big office.
Yes, it takes time to learn where
everything is. Don't worry, you'll get
used to it.
I hope so. I'm still trying to find the
HR office.
Do you need to meet someone there?
Yes, I need to meet Sarah. She said she
will show me my desk.
Oh, Sarah is very nice. Her office is
just down the hall. Second door on the
left.
Thank you. That helps a lot.
So, what is your job?
I'm a content writer. I'll be writing
blog posts and helping with social
media.
That's great. I also work on social
media.
Maybe we'll work together soon.
That sounds good. I'm excited to start.
Where did you work before this?
I worked at a small company downtown,
but I wanted something new.
Well, welcome. This team is friendly. I
think you'll like it here.
Thanks. That's good to hear. I was a
little nervous this morning.
That's normal. I was nervous on my first
day, too.
I already feel better after talking to
you.
Thanks, Jack. If you need anything, just
ask me.
I will. Oh, do we have a lunch break
together?
Yes, we all eat lunch at 100 p.m. in the
breakroom.
Perfect. Maybe I can join you today.
Of course. I'll introduce you to the
rest of the team.
Thanks again, Emma. I'll go see Sarah
now.
Okay. See you later, Jack.
See you soon.
Hi there. Excuse me. Is this room five?
Yes, this is room five. Are you in grade
seven?
Yes, I am. It's my first day here. I'm a
new student.
Oh, welcome.
What's your name? My name is Liam. And
you?
I'm Sophia. Nice to meet you, Liam.
Nice to meet you, too, Sophia.
Where are you from?
I'm from London, but I moved here last
week with my family.
Wow, that's cool.
Do you like the new city?
Yes, it's nice, but everything is still
new for me. I understand. When I was
new, I felt the same.
Thanks. I hope I make new friends soon.
Don't worry. People here are friendly. I
can help you.
That would be really nice. Thank you.
Do you like school?
Yes, but I feel a little nervous.
That's normal. The teachers are kind.
You will be fine.
I hope so. What subjects do we have
today?
I think we have English first, then
math. After that, science.
Okay. I like science.
Me too. And after lunch, we have art
class.
Nice. I like to draw.
Great. You will enjoy it. Are you
bringing lunch from home?
Yes. My mom packed a sandwich and some
fruit.
Cool. I brought rice and vegetables. We
can eat together if you want.
Really? That sounds great. I'd like
that.
Also, we have football practice after
school on Tuesdays. Do you like
football? Yes, I love football. Can I
join the team?
Of course. I'll show you where to sign
up.
Thanks, Sophia. You're really helpful.
No problem, Liam. I'm happy to help.
Let's sit together in class if that's
okay.
Sure. Come sit next to me. The teacher
is coming now.
Okay, let's
Jack, come here. Please,
>> what's wrong, Emma?

>> Yes, it started this morning, but now
it's getting worse.

>> Yes, I did. I turned it all the way, but
it still drips.
>> Maybe something is broken inside.
>> Do you think you can fix it?
>> I'm not sure, but I can try. I'll check
under the sink first.
>> Okay, be careful. The floor is wet.
>> Thanks. I'll grab a towel to dry it.
Do you need any tools?
>> Yes, I need the tool box. It has my
wrench and screwdriver.
>> It's in the cabinet, right?
>> Yes, the one near the broom. Can you get
it for me?
>> Sure, I'll bring it now.
>> Thanks, Emma. Let's fix this before it
gets worse.
>> Yes. I don't want the kitchen to flood.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it
together.
Emma, did you find the toolbox?
>> Yes, it's in the cabinet, but I couldn't
carry it.
>> Is it heavy?
>> Yes, it is.
>> Okay, let me check.
Here we are. You're right. It's a little
heavy.
Yeah, I told you.
>> I will open the tool box now.
>> What tools do you need?
>> A wrench and a screwdriver.
>> Are they inside?
>> Yes, I found them.
>> Great. Do you need anything else?
Maybe a towel in case there is water.

loose.
>> Do you need the flashlight?
>> Yes, please shine it right here under
the sink.
>> Like this?
>> Perfect. I can see everything now.
>> Is it a big problem?
>> No, I don't think so. The pipe is just
not tight enough.
>> Can you fix it?
>> I will try. I just need to turn this
slowly with the wrench.
>> Be careful. That pipe looks old.
>> Yes, I'll be gentle. Hold the flashlight
steady, please.
Okay. Turning.
Turning.
Almost done.
>> How does it look?
>> It looks better now. I think it's tight.
>> Should we test it?
>> Yes. Turn on the faucet just a little.

leaks?
>> No leaks, no drips. I think it's fixed.
>> Wow, you really did it.
>> Yes, I feel like a handyman now.
>> Should we leave the towel under the pipe
just in case?
>> Yes, good idea. Just for tonight.

day. You help, too. We make a good team.

Yes, I can change the oil for you. How
long will it take? About 30 minutes.

choice. I'll start now. You can wait
here. Thank you.
Hi, Jack. Your car is ready.

problem.
>> Oh no. What is it?

>> Really? I thought I fixed it yesterday.
Yes, it was fine at first, but now it's
dripping again.
>> That's not good. Did you try turning it

Hey, Jack. Do you want to go to the gym
today?
H. Yes, I think so. What time are you
thinking?
How about 6:00 p.m.? We can go after
work.
6:00 p.m. Sounds good to me. Not too
early, not too late.
Yes, we can eat a light snack before we
go.
Good idea. Are we doing cardio or
weights today?
Let's start with some cardio.
Maybe 20 minutes on the treadmill.
Okay. I like the treadmill. It's a good
warm-up.
After that, we can go to the weights
section.
Yes. I want to do chest and shoulder
exercises today.
Nice. Sounds like a good plan.
Do you want to walk to the gym or drive?
Let's walk. It's not far from here. And
walking is a good warm up.
I agree. We can also talk while we walk.
Yes. And don't forget to bring your
water bottle.
I won't. I put it in my bag already.
What about you?
I have mine ready, too. And I'll bring
my gym card.
Perfect. Do you want to meet outside
your building?
Yes. Let's meet at the front door at
6:00 p.m.
All right. I'll be there on time.
Great. I'm looking forward to it.
Me, too. It's always better to work out
together.
Totally. See you at 6:00 p.m., Jack.
See you later, Emma.
Wow, it's a little busy today.
Yes, a lot of people are here. I guess
everyone wants to get fit.
Yes, maybe it's because the weekend is
coming. Shall we start with the
treadmill?
Good idea. The treadmills are free now.
Let's go.
Okay, I'll run for 15 minutes. That's
enough for me.
I'll run two. Let me press quick start
on the screen.
Don't forget to drink water before you
start.
Yes, I brought my water bottle. What
about you?
Me, too. I have mine in my bag.
Great. Ready?
Ready. Let's go.
I'm finished. My legs are tired already.
Same here. That was a good warm up.
Yes. Now, let's go to the weights
section.
Sure. I want to do some chest exercises.
I want to use the dumbbells.
Where are they?
They're over there next to the big
mirror.
Thanks. I'll start with some arm curls.
Nice. I'll use the bench press for a
bit.
How many sets are you doing?
Maybe three sets. Not too heavy today.
Sounds good. I'll do the same.
Hey, Emma. How are you doing with the
weights?
I'm good. I just finished my arm curls.
Nice. How many sets did you do?
I did three sets of 10. My arms feel
tired now.
That's a good workout. I just finished
my last set, too.
Great. Let's stretch after this. Okay.
Yes, stretching is important. I don't
want sore muscles tomorrow.
Me neither. Just 5 minutes of stretching
is fine for me.
Agreed. We can stretch near the mats.
Perfect. Then we can shower and go home.
Yes. And I'm already getting hungry. Me
too. I didn't eat much before the gym.
Let's get something healthy to eat after
this.
Like a smoothie or a salad.
Yes, smoothie sounds perfect right now,
Jim. Then food. I love this combo.
I like it, too. We should do this more
often.
Definitely.
same time next week.
Let's do it.
That was a good workout.
Yes, I feel great. A little tired, but
happy.
Same here. My arms are still shaking a
little.
That means you worked hard. Well done.
Thanks. So, are we getting smoothies
now?
Yes. Do you know a place nearby?
Yes, there's a smoothie shop just around
the corner.
Perfect. Let's walk there.
Okay. What smoothie are you going to
get?
H maybe strawberry and banana.
you.
I think I'll get mango. I love mangoes.
Mango is good. I had it last time.
Do you want to sit there or take it to
go?
Let's sit for a bit. We can rest and
talk.
Sounds nice. We earned it.
Yes, we did. Workout then smoothie. Best
combo.
Let's go. I'm thirsty now.
[Music]
This smoothie is so good.
Yes, I like mine, too. Very fresh.
What flavor did you get again?
Strawberry and banana. It's my favorite.
Nice choice.
I got mango.
It's sweet and cold. Perfect after the
gym.
Yes, it's a great way to cool down.
Do you come here often?
Not really. Maybe once a month. What
about you?
I've been here a few times.
I like the drinks here.
The place is quiet, too. I like that.
Yes, it's nice to sit and rest for a
bit.
How do you feel after the workout?
Tired, but good. I think I'll sleep well
tonight.
Me too. We worked hard today.
Yes. I'm happy we came. Let's do this
again next week
for sure. Gym and smoothies. It's our
new routine.
Deal.
That smoothie was really good.
Yes, I enjoyed it a lot. Thanks for the
idea.
You're welcome. I'm glad we went.
Me, too. Today was fun. Gym and
smoothie. A great mix.
Yes, it felt good to exercise and relax
after.
Now I just want a shower and some rest.
Same here. My legs are tired.
But in a good way, right?
Yes, in a good way. I feel strong.
That's the best part of working out.
True.
Oh, look. We're almost at my building.
That was a nice walk. The evening air
feels cool.
Yes, it's peaceful now. A good way to
end the day.
All right, I'll see you next time.
Yes, same day next week.
You got it. Don't forget your water
bottle again.
I won't. Thanks again, Jack.
Anytime. Good night, Emma.
Good night.
Hello.
Welcome to the salon.
How can I help you today?
Hi, I'd like to get a haircut, please.
Great. Do you already have an
appointment?
No, I don't. I was just walking by. Is
it okay to walk in?
Yes, that's no problem at all.
We're not too busy today. There is no
wait. You're lucky.
Oh, that's great. I wasn't sure if I
needed to call first.
We take walk-ins, so you're welcome
anytime.
Would you like something to drink? Water
or tea?
A glass of water would be nice. Thank
you.
Of course. Here you go. Please come sit
in this chair when you're ready.
Thank you so much. It looks very clean
and nice in here.
Thank you. We try to keep it friendly
and relaxing for everyone.
So, how would you like your haircut
today?
I want it shorter, but not too short.
Just a little trim, please.
Okay, no problem. Do you want to keep
the same style?
Yes, I like this style. Just make it a
bit neater.
All right, I'll tidy it up. And the
sides. Should I cut them, too?
Yes, but only a little bit. Not too much
on the sides.
Got it. I'll trim the sides just a
little. What about the back? Do you want
it straight or rounded?
Straight, please. That's what I usually
get.
Perfect. Would you like a shampoo before
the haircut?
Yes, please. That would be nice. My hair
feels a bit dusty.
No problem at all. A wash will help.
Please follow me to the wash station.
It's just over here.
Okay, thank you.
Is the water okay? Not too hot?
Yes, it's perfect. Very comfortable.
Thank you.
Good. I'll use a little shampoo now. Let
me know if anything feels wrong.
Okay, no problem.
All right, I'm rinsing the shampoo now.
still okay?
Yes, it feels nice. Very relaxing.
I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'll dry
your hair a little with a towel.
Okay, thank you.
All done here. Let's go back to the
chair now. I'll start your haircut.
Sounds good. I'm ready.
So, do you live nearby?
Yes, I live just two streets away. Very
close.
That's nice. It's easy for you to come
here.
Yes, I like that. I walked here today.
Great.
Have you been to this salon before?
No, this is my first time here.
Oh, welcome.
I'm happy you came.
Thanks. The salon looks very clean and
nice.
Thank you. We try our best to keep it
nice for everyone.
I hope you like your haircut, too.
I'm sure I will. You're doing a great
job.
All right. All finished. What do you
think?
Wow, it looks really good. I like it a
lot.
I'm so happy to hear that. I tried to
keep the same style, just cleaner and
shorter.
Yes, it's perfect. Just what I wanted.
Thank you.
You're very welcome. Would you like some
gel or spray to style it?
No, thank you. I like it just like this.
Simple and natural.
Okay, no problem. I'm glad you're happy
with it.
Yes, very happy. You did a great job.
Thank you. That makes me smile.
So, how much is the haircut?
The haircut is $10.
Here you go. I'll give you 12. Please
keep the change.
Thank you so much. That's very kind of
you.
You're welcome. You were very friendly
and helpful.
Thank you. I hope you have a wonderful
day.
You too. I'll come back next time for
sure.
We'd love to see you again. Take care
and goodbye.
Goodbye.
Good morning. Welcome to the store. Can
I help you?
Good morning. Yes, please. I need some
eggs. Sure.
The eggs are on the second shelf next to
the milk.
Thank you. I see them now. I'll take one
box.
Great. Do you need anything else?
Yes. I'm looking for apples. Do you have
any today?
Yes, we do. We have red apples
and green apples.
What's the price for the red apples?
They are $2 per bag. Each bag has six
apples.
That's good. I'll take one bag of red
apples.
All right. Would you like a bag for your
items?
Yes, please. I also need one loaf of
bread.
No problem. We have white bread and
brown bread. Which one would you like?
White bread, please.
Do you also sell butter? Yes, we have
butter in the fridge section near the
cheese.
Great. I'll get one pack of butter, too.
Okay. So, you have eggs, apples, bread,
and butter. Is that everything?
Yes. That's all for today.
How much is it?
Let's see.
That's $8 in total.
Here is $10.
Thank you. Here is your change. $2 and
your receipt.
Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
You too. Take care.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Welcome to the fish market. How can I
help you today?
I'd like to buy some fish, please.
Of course. What kind of fish are you
looking for?
I'm not sure. What do you have that's
fresh today?
The salmon is very fresh. We also have
red snapper,
tuna, and shrimp.
H, the salmon looks nice. Is it wild or
farmed?
It's wild. Caught early this morning.
Great. I'll take one kilo of salmon,
please.
1 kilo of salmon.
Anything else?
Yes. I also need some shrimp. Are they
fresh, too?
Yes, very fresh. We cleaned them this
morning.
Perfect. I'll take half a kilo of
shrimp.
All right. 1 kilo of salmon, half a kilo
of shrimp. Do you want me to clean the
salmon?
Yes, please. And can you remove the
skin?
Sure, no problem.
Thanks. Oh, do you sell lemons?
No, but the fruit stall next to me has
some.
Okay, I'll go there next.
Good idea. Fish and lemon go well
together.
Yes, they do.
All right. Here's your fish and shrimp
all cleaned and packed.
Thank you. How much is it?
That's $12.50
in total.
Here you go. $15.
Keep the change.
Thank you very much. You're very kind.
You're welcome. Have a nice day.
You too. Enjoy your meal.
Hello. Can I help you?
Yes, please. I'm looking for a shirt.
What color do you want?
I want a blue shirt.
Okay. What size do you wear?
Medium.
Here is a blue shirt in size medium.
Would you like to try it on?
Yes, please. Where is the changing room?
It's over there next to the mirror.
Thank you.
It fits well. I like it.
Great. Do you want to buy it?
Yes. How much is it?
It's $25.
Okay, I'll take it.
Would you like to pay by cash or card?
By card, please.
Here you go. Please enter your pen.
Done.
Thank you. Here's your receipt and your
shirt.
Thank you. Have a nice day.
You too. Goodbye.
Hello. Welcome to the pharmacy. How can
I help you today?
Hi, I need some medicine, please.
Sure. What kind of medicine are you
looking for?
I have a headache. It started this
morning and it's getting worse.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any
other symptoms like a fever, sore
throat, or a cold?
No, just a headache. I feel a little
tired, but no fever.
Okay. Do you have allergies to any
medicine?
No, I don't think so.
All right. I recommend these pain relief
tablets. They're good for headaches.
How do I take them?
Take one tablet every 6 hours after
food.
Do not take more than four tablets in 24
hours.
Got it. Can I take it with tea?
Yes, that's fine. Just not with coffee
or energy drinks.
Okay, thank you. How much is the box?
It's $5 for 20 tablets.
That's good. I'll take one box, please.
Here you go.
Do you need anything else today?
[Music]
Yes. Do you have hand sanitizer?
Yes, we have small and large bottles.
The small one is $2 and the large one is
four.
I'll take the small one, please.
Great. So, that's $5 for the tablets and
$2 for the sanitizer.
$7 in total. Here's $10.
Thank you. Here's your change, $3.
And your receipt.
Thanks. You've been very helpful.
You're welcome. I hope you feel better
soon.
Thank you. Have a nice day.
You too. Take care.
Hello. Can I help you?
Yes, please. I'm looking for a book.
Okay. What kind of book do you want?
I want a novel. Something easy to read.
We have many novels. Do you want a love
story, a mystery, or a funny book?
A funny book, please.
All right. Here is a popular funny
novel. It's good for English learners.
Great. How much is it?
It's $10.
Okay, I'll take it. Do you sell
notebooks, too?
Yes, we do. They are over there next to
the pens.
Thank you. I'll take one notebook as
well.
No problem. Anything else?
No, that's all. How much in total?
$12.
10 for the book, two for the notebook.
Here you go.
Thank you. Here is your receipt.
Thanks. Have a nice day.
You too.
Hi,
can I have a coffee, please?
Sure. What kind of coffee?
One small latte, please.
Would you like it hot or iced?
Hot, please.
Okay. Anything else?
Yes. One chocolate muffin.
Got it. One small hot latte and one
muffin.
Yes, that's right.
That's $450.
Here you go.
Thank you. Please wait over there. I'll
call your name.
Thanks,
Emma. Your coffee is ready.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome. Enjoy.
Honey, wake up. It is 7:00.
Time to get up.
[Music]
Just five more minutes, please. I am so
sleepy.
No, sleepy head. You said that 5 minutes
ago.
You will be late for work. Come on. H I
barely slept last night. I was thinking
about my project.
I know, love. I heard you get up in the
middle of the night, but I made your
coffee. It's hot and waiting for you on
the table.
Really? You made my coffee? You are the
best wife in the world.
Okay, I'm getting up now. Slowly.
That's my man. The day is starting. We
can do it together.
I will make us some toast now.
You are the best. I love you.
I love you, too. Now hurry or your
coffee will get cold.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Yeah, I did. Thanks.
Something smells amazing.
I made scrambled eggs and toast. Want
some coffee?
Yes, please. You know, I can't start my
day without it.
I know. Here you go.
Thanks.
The eggs are perfect.
Glad you like them. Do you want some
fruit, too?
Sure. Just a few slices of apple. What
about you? Did you eat?
Not yet. I was waiting to eat with you.
That's sweet. Let's eat together then.
I am ready. I am going to work now.
Okay. Did you eat enough?
Yes. The eggs were very good. Thank you.
You are welcome. Do you have your keys?
Yes, I have them and my wallet.
Good. It will be cold later. Take your
jacket.
Oh, you are right. Thank you. I will get
it. Oh, do you need anything from the
store on my way back?
H maybe just some milk and bread.
Okay, I'll text you before I leave the
office.
Perfect. Drive safe. Okay,
I will. I will call you later.
Okay. I love you.
I love you, too. Bye.
Bye.
Hello. Hi. Good morning. Are you busy?
No, I am not busy. I just ate breakfast
with my husband. How are you? I am good.
I am still in bed. I woke up 10 minutes
ago.
Oh, you are lucky. I woke up early. I
made breakfast and cleaned the house.
You are very busy. I need to get up. I
will make coffee now.
Yes, get coffee.
Always get coffee.
You are right. Okay, I will make coffee.
What are you doing today?
I will clean a little. Maybe I will go
to the store later. We need milk. What
about you?
I have a meeting at noon.
After that I am free. We can talk or
meet. That sounds nice. We can meet. It
has been a long time. Yes. We always say
we will meet but we don't. Let's meet
this weekend. Yes. How about brunch?
Brunch is great. What about the new
cafe? The one with the pancakes.
Yes, I want to try it. I heard they have
good coffee, too. Perfect. Pancakes and
coffee. It's a date. I will check the
hours and send you a message.
Sounds good. Let me know. I will be
free. Great. I will go make coffee now.
Good idea. Talk soon. Yes. Talk soon.
Love you. Love you too. Bye.
Hello. I need some milk, please.
Hello.
How much milk do you need?
One liter, please.
Okay, here you are. That is $1.
Thank you. I also need some bread.
We have white bread and brown bread.
White bread, please. One loaf.
Here is the bread. Anything else?
Yes. Do you have any apples?
Yes, we have apples. They are $2 for one
bag.
Okay, I will take one bag. So that is $3
in total.
No, that is $4.
One for milk, one for bread, and two for
apples.
Oh, you are right. $4.
Here you are.
Thank you. Have a nice day.
You, too. Goodbye.
Hi, I'm home.
Hi. Welcome back. How was your day?
It was okay. I'm a little tired.
You look tired. Do you want to sit down?
Yes, thank you. My feet hurt.
I made your favorite dinner. Rice and
chicken.
Really? That sounds great. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you want to eat now?
Yes, please. I'm very hungry.
Okay, I'll bring the food.
You are the best. I'm lucky to have you.
I know. Let's eat.
Dinner was very good. I am so full.
I'm happy you liked it. Now, let's
relax.
What do you want to watch?
H maybe a funny show. Something easy.
Okay, I will look on Netflix.
Oh, do you want to try that new show?
People say it is good.
Yes. If it is not good, we can stop.
Good idea.
Do we have any snacks?
Yes, I made popcorn already.
Wow, you are the best.
I know. Now, be quiet. The show is
starting.
Okay.
That show was good. Better than I
thought.
Yes, I laughed a lot. The funny neighbor
was great.
His dancing was so silly.
I know. Now I feel very sleepy.
Me, too. Let's brush our teeth and go to
bed.
Okay. Ready for sleep?
Wait, just 2 minutes. I want to look at
my phone.
You always say that.
No, really, only 2 minutes.
Okay, I will sleep in 1 minute. Good
night.
Good night. And hey,
yes,
thank you for today. It was a nice day
because I was with you.
Aw, you're sweet when you're tired.
Only for you. Come close. Cuddle time.
Best part of the day.
I feel so tired today. I barely slept
last night again.
Yeah, you look a bit worn out.
Everything okay?
I don't know. I just feel off. I've been
eating whatever, sleeping late, skipping
breakfast. I think it's all catching up
with me.
Oh, I totally get it. I was like that a
few months ago. No energy, always tired.
That's actually when I decided to change
things up.
Really? I didn't notice much. What did
you change?
Nothing crazy. I just started eating
better, drinking more water, and moving
a little every day. I even go to the gym
a few times a week now.
Wow, that sounds ambitious.
I don't even know where to start.
It doesn't have to be big. I started
with walking 10 minutes after lunch.
That's it. Then I added one small thing
each week.
H I guess I could try something like
that. I just feel like I've lost
control. Too much takeout, too much
coffee, zero veggies.
Trust me, you're not alone. But
honestly, small steps really work. You'd
be surprised how much better you feel
just by drinking more water or eating a
real lunch. I like the sound of small
steps. Maybe I could start by packing
lunch a few times this week. Healthier
stuff.
That's perfect. Want to do a little
challenge together?
What kind of challenge?
Let's keep it simple. This week, we both
drink at least six glasses of water a
day and try to cook one meal at home.
Deal?
H deal. But only if coffee still counts
as a drink.
Nice try, but nope. Water only. I'll
even make a tracker we can both use.
We'll check in on Friday.
Okay, fine. You're on. Thanks, Jake. I
needed this little push today.
Anytime. Let's do this together.
That was a great first step. Emma opened
up about how she's been feeling lately,
and Jake offered her encouragement
without any pressure.
Sometimes all we need is a friend who
listens and a small challenge to get us
going.
Let's see what happens next on their
healthy journey. Hey, look at us walking
after work like healthy people. Who are
we?
I know, right? I can't believe I'm
actually doing this and enjoying it.
Fresh air feels nice after sitting all
day.
Told you it clears your head. Plus, you
already hit your step goal today, didn't
you?
I did. I walked to the office instead of
taking a taxi this morning. That's a
win, right?
Absolutely. That's a big win. What about
meals? Any home-cooked stuff yet?
Yep. I made grilled chicken with veggies
on Tuesday. It wasn't fancy, but it was
colorful and tasted good. Also, less
takeout this week.
Nice. See, one step at a time. And how's
the water challenge?
Well, I only managed four glasses on
Monday, but I got better each day.
Today, I'm at 6:00 already.
Boom. Progress. You know, a lot of
people quit because they want everything
to change overnight, but we're building
habits. Yeah, I like this approach. No
pressure, just steady changes. Honestly,
I feel a little more energetic in the
mornings now.
Same here. I even slept better this
week. I started stretching before bed.
It helps me calm down.
Ooh, I might try that tonight. Do you
follow a video? Or
just a 5-minute routine I found on
YouTube. Nothing fancy. I'll send it to
you.
Thanks. Oh, and guess what? My coworker
noticed I brought lunch from home. She
wants to join the healthy club, too.
We're starting a movement. All right,
next week's challenge. Want to pick it?
H how about we try adding one fruit to
our day? Like an actual piece of fruit,
not juice.
Deal. Banana squad, let's go.
Banana squad. This is actually kind of
fun.
That's the point. If it's fun, we'll
stick to it. Proud of you, Emma. Right
back at you, Coach Jake.
Emma and Jake are off to a great start.
They're already feeling better, moving
more, and even inspiring others.
But as we all know, forming new habits
isn't always easy. In the next chapter,
they'll face their first real challenge.
Let's see how they handle it.
I have a confession to make. I didn't
cook a single meal this week.
That makes two of us. I had pizza twice
and I skipped the gym twice.
I feel like I lost all the progress we
made. I was so motivated last week. What
happened?
Life happened. I had deadlines, barely
slept, and honestly, I just wanted
comfort food.
Same here. Work was a mess. I got home
late every night and cooking felt
impossible.
Okay, let's not beat ourselves up. It's
one rough week. That doesn't erase
everything we've done so far.
I know. I just felt disappointed in
myself. Like I gave up too easily.
You didn't give up. You're sitting here
talking about it. And that means you
still care. That's what matters. Thanks,
Jake. I needed to hear that. I guess
being healthy isn't just about food or
exercise. It's about handling weeks like
this, too.
Exactly. It's part of the process. The
goal isn't to be perfect, just to keep
going.
Okay. So, what now? Do we start over?
Nope. We keep going. Let's call it a
reset. How about we plan one healthy
thing for tomorrow?
M I'll pack a real lunch. No excuses.
Perfect. And I'll do that stretch
routine before bed tonight. Let's check
in tomorrow and see how it goes.
Deal. And hey, thanks for not judging
me.
Are you kidding? We're in this together.
Pizza and all. That was a real moment
and a powerful one.
Emma and Jake reminded us that setbacks
are part of any journey. What matters is
getting back up and trying again. Even
if it's just one small step.
Okay, I have to admit chopping veggies
is kind of relaxing. I forgot how nice
it is to cook with someone.
Told you it's more fun than eating out
of a plastic container in front of your
laptop.
Guilty. That was literally me last
night. But hey, I packed a healthy lunch
today like I said I would.
Nice. I did my stretch routine again and
it actually helped with my back pain.
We're slowly getting back on track.
Honestly, this feels good. Not just the
food, but slowing down, doing something
real.
Yep. That's what I've learned. Healthy
habits aren't just about rules. It's
about choosing things that make you feel
good long term.
I like that. No more all or nothing
thinking, just small, steady wins.
Exactly. Speaking of wins, this stir fry
smells amazing, if I do say so myself.
It really does. And no added junk. Just
fresh stuff and flavor.
All right, Chef Emma, are we ready to
plate up?
Let's do it. Oh, and remind me to text
my coworker the recipe. She's been
asking what we've been eating lately.
Our healthy journey is becoming
contagious.
Next week, let's try something new, like
yoga or even a cooking class.
You read my mind. I saw a weekend class
that sounds fun. Let's sign up.
Deal. Look at us barely surviving last
week and now planning yoga with stir fry
in hand. That's growth. One step at a
time.
Emma and Jake made a powerful choice to
keep going even after a rough week
by cooking together, sharing a laugh,
and setting new goals. They proved that
progress isn't about being perfect. It's
about staying connected,
staying kind to yourself, and starting
fresh when needed.
Okay, I'm officially a different person.
I got up early this morning to stretch
on purpose. No alarm panic.
Who even are you? I used to call you
Captain Snooze Button.
I know, right? But it actually felt
good. I didn't rush out the door like a
maniac.
I love that. I've noticed it, too. I
feel way more focused at work now. And I
don't crash at 3 p.m. anymore.
That's the food for sure. No more sugar
highs and food comas. What'd you bring
for lunch?
Quinoa salad with chickpeas and roasted
veggies. Colorful and crunchy. You
chicken and avocado wrap, plus some
fruit. Who are we?
the people who used to live on vending
machine snacks. Now we meal prep.
And I sleep better, like actually rest.
I used to toss and turn all night.
Same. And my mood's better. I don't snap
at every little thing now. My coworker
even said I seem peaceful. Can you
believe that?
I can. You've got that healthy glow
going on. It's awesome.
Thanks, Jake. I feel proud. Honestly, we
didn't just say we'd change. We actually
did it.
We still are bit by bit. And hey, we're
inspiring people. My sister started
walking every morning because of us.
Really? That's amazing. I think my mom's
even trying my lunch recipes.
Told you health is contagious.
So, what's next? We've got food, water,
movement, maybe something for the mind.
Ooh, meditation or journaling? I heard
writing down your thoughts helps with
stress.
Let's try both. 10 minutes a day.
Nothing big.
Done. We're unstoppable.
Captain Snooze and Queen Coffee turning
into wellness warriors.
Emma and Jake aren't just feeling
better, they're living better. Their
small choices have turned into real
changes and now they're inspiring
others, too. But this journey isn't just
about personal growth. In the next
chapter, they'll use what they've
learned to help someone else take the
first step.
Okay. I have to ask, what's your secret?
You both look calm and happy. What are
you doing?
Not a secret, actually. We just started
making small healthy changes a few weeks
ago. Nothing extreme.
Yeah, we started with drinking more
water, cooking a few simple meals, and
going for short walks after work. That's
all really? That sounds doable. I
thought you were doing something
intense, like some crazy diet or boot
camp.
Nope, no boot camp here. Just baby
steps. Like last week we added
journaling for 10 minutes a day. That's
it.
And honestly, the hardest part was just
starting. Once we had a routine, it got
easier. I've been wanting to feel
better, too. I just get overwhelmed. I
don't even know where to begin.
That's how we felt at first, but we made
a rule. One change at a time. One small
win each week. Hey, if someone else
wants to start, we could help them, too.
Maybe pick one thing and check in each
week. Really? That would be amazing. I
think I want to start walking more. I
sit way too much.
Perfect. Even 10 minutes a day is a
great start. Like walking after work or
prepping a real lunch instead of just
snacks.
Yes, please. And maybe I'll bring a real
lunch next week instead of just
crackers. That's the spirit. We can even
share some of our go-to recipes. Nothing
fancy, just tasty and simple. Thanks,
guys. This feels less scary now. It
actually sounds fun.
It is fun. We joke about it all the
time. We even call ourselves the banana
squad.
And now it's official. The squad is
growing. Love it. Let's do this.
Emma and Jake didn't set out to be role
models, but by focusing on small,
consistent changes, they became just
that. Now they're passing on what
they've learned and supporting someone
else's journey.
In the final chapter, they'll look back
at how far they've come and dream a
little about where they're heading next.
You know, two months ago, I could barely
get out of bed without groaning. Now, I
wake up and stretch without even
thinking about it.
Right. I used to roll out of bed like a
zombie. Now I'm up, moving, even making
smoothies. Like a real adult. H a
healthy adult, no less. I feel like a
different version of myself.
Same here. I'm calmer, less stressed,
and weirdly, I'm proud. Like, we
actually followed through.
Exactly. We didn't give up when it got
hard. We just adjusted. That's big.
You know what else is big? the fact that
Maya's still walking with us every week
and my sister texts me daily about her
new food swaps.
And my mom made a quinoa salad last
night with roasted veggies on purpose.
We're basically health influencers now,
minus the sponsorships.
Not yet, but I've been thinking, what if
we start a little blog or Instagram page
just to share recipes, tips, our ups and
downs? That would be amazing. No
pressure, just real stuff from real
people.
Exactly. And maybe we sign up for that
5K charity run next month. Just for fun.
Let's do it. We've come this far. What's
five more kilome?
I love this version of us. Not perfect,
not extreme, just consistent and
growing.
Bit by bit. That's the magic. Emma and
Jake's journey started with one small
decision, a single conversation over
coffee. And from there, it grew into
something bigger. Better habits,
stronger friendships, and a new sense of
confidence.
They didn't need to change everything
overnight. They just kept moving forward
together. and their story.
[Music]
Hey, hey. Welcome to English Phrases
Hub, the place where business English
doesn't have to be boring. I'm Emma,
your friendly meeting sidekick. And
today, o, we've got something every
professional needs. Whether you're in
the boardroom, on Zoom, or secretly in
your pajamas under the desk, we're
talking about business meeting phrases.
That's right, 50 super useful phrases to
help you sound clear, smart, and like
you totally know what you're doing, even
if you secretly don't. All right. So,
here's how we're going to roll today.
We're breaking down the 50 phrases into
seven parts, just like a real meeting.
We've got one, starting the meeting
phrases. Two, reviewing previous
meetings phrases.
Three, updates, clarification, and
discussion phrases. Four, decisionmaking
and action planning phrases. Five,
managing time and flow phrases. Six,
closing the meeting phrases. Seven,
followup and next steps phrases.
For each part, I'll say the phrase in a
slow repeat after me style, like
shadowing. Then I'll explain how and
when to use it and toss in some handy
tips. And here's the fun bit. At the end
of each part, we'll have a short realife
style dialogue using those phrases so
you can hear them in action. So grab
that notebook or your ice latte and
let's jump into part one.
All right, part one, starting the
meeting.
This is that moment when everyone's just
logged in, your camera's showing a weird
angle of your ceiling, and you're hoping
someone else speaks first, but nope,
you've got this. Let's go through some
smooth ways to kick things off like a
total pro.
Phrase one.

and not here to just wander through 45

take a quick look at the agenda." If you
want something shorter,
phrase three, I'd like to welcome our
new team member to today's meeting.

golden phrases locked and loaded, let's
hear them in action. Picture this. It's
Monday morning. Everyone's got coffee in
hand. There are a few sleepy faces on
Zoom. And boom, the manager steps up and
starts the meeting like a total pro.
Here's a short dialogue so you can hear
how these phrases sound in a real
business meeting setting. Let's listen
to how the manager kicks things off.

if you're not speaking. Cool. Let's
roll.
>> See how smooth that sounded? Just five
or six wellplaced phrases and suddenly
you're the boss of the meeting.
All right, now that you've nailed the
art of kicking things off, let's move on
to part two. Reviewing the last meeting,
or as I like to call it, did anyone
actually do what they said they would or
nah. This is where we check in, follow
up, and gently remind people that action
items are more than just bullet points
on a slide. Let's get into it.
Phrase number seven.

last meeting.

the action items
from our last meeting.

on instead of discuss if you want to
keep it casual.

the previous meeting.

like a lovely time manager. not a
meeting monster. It's great when people
start wandering off topic. Just gently
bring it back with this phrase.
Okay, so let's hear how these phrases
actually sound in a real meeting.
Picture this. The team's all in.
Coffey's brewing. Someone's already
late, of course, and the manager jumps
in to keep things on track. Let's listen
in.

let's discuss the action items from our
last meeting.
I'd also like to address the issues
raised in the previous meeting,
especially around delivery delays.
And just a quick reminder, let's make
sure we stick to the agenda to respect
everyone's time.
>> Nice work. You've officially learned how
to follow up without sounding like the
office detective.
Whether it's checking on action items or
gently reminding folks to stick to the
agenda, you're keeping things
professional and polite.
Now, let's roll into part three.

and all that juicy discussion.

laser focused, those are the real life
lines that keep meetings productive and
professional. Now you're ready to walk

middle section where all the action
happens. All right, it's time for the
real deal. The part where we stop
talking about things and start deciding
things. Welcome to part four,

action. Picture this. The team has just
finished the main discussion. Everyone's
kind of waiting for someone to speak up
and boom, the manager takes charge.

for completing the tasks discussed
today. Aim to have everything ready by
next Friday. Sound good?
See that? Clear, confident, and no
confusion left behind. That's how you
take a meeting from talking to doing.
And that's a wrap for part one of our
business meeting phrases series. We
covered how to start a meeting like a
pro, how to follow up without sounding
bossy, how to ask for updates without
the awkwardness, and how to make
decisions and assign tasks like an
absolute legend. Seriously, you're no
longer just surviving meetings, you're
running them. But hey, we're not done
yet. In part two, we'll cover the rest
of the phrases. how to keep the meeting
on track, how to wrap things up
smoothly, and what to say after the
meeting ends so nothing falls through
the cracks. So, if you haven't already,
make sure to subscribe, hit that
notification bell, and grab your ice
latte for part two. I'll see you there.
Hey, hey. What's up, my English learning
legends? It's Emma here, and today we're
talking about the thing that makes the
world go round. Yep, money.
Or as I like to call it, that mysterious
creature that disappears every time I
open my wallet. Seriously, where does it
go? Quick question for you. Do you ever
get totally confused when people start
talking about money in English? Like
someone says, "I'm broke." And you're
thinking, "Wait, do I need to call an
ambulance?" Or maybe someone says,
"Let's split the bill." And you just
smile, nod, and have no idea what they
mean. If that sounds like you, this
episode is definitely for you. But don't
worry, you're not alone. And today,
we're going to fix that. In this
episode, we're diving into the world of
money. You'll learn the most useful
money vocabulary,
money idioms and phrasal verbs, super
everyday phrases you'll actually hear in
real life, and you'll even get to listen
in on some realworld dialogues to hear
how these are actually used.
Oh, and of course, we'll throw in a
quick quiz and a fun little challenge at
the end. So, don't go anywhere. This
video is perfect for beginners and
intermediate learners, especially if
you're learning English as a second
language, planning to travel, working in
business, or just want to sound more
confident when talking about your
wallet. So, grab a snack, preferably
something cheap if you're broke like me,
and stick with me till the end. You
won't want to miss a single penny of
this information.
All right, let's jump in.
Let's start with the basics. We can't
talk about money in English if we don't
know the words for it, right? These are
the fundamental words you'll hear and
use constantly when discussing money.
Word number one, money. Yep, the
classic, the boss, the main character.
Money is the general word we use for
cash, points, banknotes, credit, all of
it. Example, I don't have enough money
to go on vacation, so I'm just going to
vacation in my living room. Word number
two, cash. Cash is that physical paper
money. You know, the stuff that
disappears way too fast. Example: Sorry,
I only take cash. Your card's no good
here, partner.
Word number three, coins. Tiny, noisy,
and always hiding at the bottom of your
bag. Example, I found enough coins in my
couch to buy coffee. Okay, maybe just a
sip of coffee. Word number four, bills.
No, not bill from accounting. I mean
paper money or the amount you need to
pay. Double meaning alert. Example one,
I paid with a $10 bill. Example two. Uh,
my internet bill is too high this month.
Word number five, credit card. The magic
plastic rectangle that lets you buy
things now and panic later. Example, I
forgot my wallet, but I've got my credit
card. Word number six, change. The
little money you get back after paying,
usually in coins, or the thing cashiers
never seem to have. Example, here's your
change and a receipt you'll never look
at. Word number seven, price. The number
you see on a tag and pretend not to be
shocked by. Example, that jacket looks
amazing. Oh, the price. Never mind. Word
number eight, cost.
kind of like price, but we use it
differently in sentences. Example, how
much does it cost? Answer: Too much.
Always too much.
Word number nine,
income,
outcome.
Oo, now we're getting into serious money
talk.
Income is the money that comes in like
your salary or that one time your
grandma gave you birthday cash.
Example,
my monthly income is $1,500.
Nice
outcome is a bit tricky.
Some people confuse it with expenses,
but technically outcome just means the
result of something. So in finance, we
usually say expenses instead, but you
might still hear financial outcome when
someone's being extra formal or
businessy.
All right, now that we've got our basic
money words down, let's talk about what
we do with money or what money does to
us. This section is all about those
juicy action verbs that'll help you
sound smart and confident in any money
conversation.
Let's go. Verb number one, to earn. This
is how the money enters your life. You
work, you hustle, and boom, you earn.
Example, I earn $15 an hour flipping
burgers and flipping bad attitudes.
Whether it's a job or a side gig, that's
your income. Verb number two, to spend.
Ah, yes, the fun part. To spend means to
use your money to buy something,
necessary or absolutely not necessary,
but it was on sale. Example, I spent way
too much on snacks last night. Zero
regrets. Verb number three, to save.
This is the smart one of the group. To
save is to not spend, to keep your money
for later. You know, like adults are
supposed to do.
Example, I'm trying to save for a
vacation. So far, I've saved $5.
Verb number four, to borrow.
To borrow means you take money from
someone, but you promise to give it
back. Basically, hey, can I have money?
I'll totally pay you back someday.
Example, I borrowed $100 from my friend.
Now I owe her coffee forever. Verb
number five, to lend. If you're the
generous one, you lend money. That's
when you give someone money temporarily
and pray they don't forget. Example, I
lent my brother $50 and now he avoids
eye contact.
Verb number six, to invest. Now this one
makes you sound fancy. To invest is when
you put your money into something like
stocks or a business hoping it grows.
Kind of like planting a money tree.
Example, I invested in a small company.
It's either going to make me rich or
give me stress wrinkles.
Verb number seven, to withdraw.
To take money out of your bank account.
Example, I withdrew $40 and it vanished
in 30 minutes. Verb number eight, to
deposit.
Opposite of withdraw. This means putting
money into your account. Example, I
deposited my paycheck. It was nice while
it lasted.
Verb number nine, to pay. Yep. This is
the moment we say goodbye to our money.
We pay for stuff. Bills, food, shoes we
don't need but definitely love. Example,
I paid $10 for parking. That's half a
pizza. Painful.
Verb number 10, to refund.
This is when the money comes back to
you. usually because something went
wrong or didn't fit. Example, the shoes
didn't fit, so I asked for a refund and
cried a little.
So many ways to move money around,
right? Whether you're earning it,
spending it, saving it, or awkwardly
chasing your friend to get it back. Now
you've got the verbs to talk about it
all like a pro. Okay. Okay. Now that
we've talked about all the serious
stuff, let's get into the fun zone.
Because English isn't just about what we
say, it's about how weirdly we say it.
So, let's check out some super common
and sometimes hilarious idioms and
phrasal verbs about money. Get ready
because these will make you sound like a
native speaker who knows how to laugh at
their bank account.
Number one, break the bank. No, we're
not robbing anything. To break the bank
means something is super expensive.
Example, that new phone almost broke the
bank, but it takes really good selfies,
so it's fine. Number two, tight on
money. This is the nice way of saying,
"I'm broke. Send help." Example, I'd
love to go out, but I'm a little tight
on money this week. Like peanut butter
jar tight.
Number three, splash out or splurge.
Both of these mean to spend a lot of
money, usually on something fun or
fancy. Example, I splashed out on a new
jacket. Was it necessary? Nope. Was it
fabulous? Absolutely.
Number four, pick up the tab. This means
to pay the bill, especially at a
restaurant or cafe. Example, don't
worry, I'll pick up the tab. Just
promise to split dessert with me. Number
five, cut back on. If your wallet is
crying, you may need to cut back on your
spending. It means to reduce how much
money you spend on something. Example,
I'm cutting back on takeout. My bank
account needs a break and so does my
stomach.
Number six, pay off. To pay off
something means to finish paying it,
like a loan or a credit card. Example, I
finally paid off my student loan. Now I
just owe my soul.
Number seven, live paycheck to paycheck.
This one's a little too real. It means
you're just getting by. Your income
covers your bills, but there's nothing
left. Example, I'm living paycheck to
paycheck right now, so no weekend yacht
trips for me. Again,
English really knows how to describe our
money struggles with style, huh?
These phrases are all over casual
conversations in TV shows, movies, daily
life. So, if you can drop one of these
in, you'll instantly sound more fluent
and maybe a little cooler. All righty.
Now that you've got the idioms in your
pocket, let's move on to the realworld
practical phrases you can use when
talking about money, shopping, bills, or
that awkward moment when your friend
wants to split the bill exactly down to
the last scent. Let's go.
All right, my brilliant learner. Now
that we've got the vocab, verbs, and all
those idioms bouncing around in your
brain, let's make things even more
useful. Because let's be honest, you
don't just want to understand money
phrases. You want to use them like a pro
in real conversations at the grocery
store, at the bank, with friends, even
when you're trying to explain why your
card just declined.
Let's go.
One, how much does it cost? This one's
essential, like survival level. Example,
hi, how much does it cost? Use it at
markets, shops, anywhere you don't want
surprises when the receipt comes.
Two, that's too expensive. A polite way
of saying yikes, I'm not paying that.
Example, ooh, I love this jacket, but
that's too expensive for me right now.
Three, do you accept credit cards?
So useful, especially if you're
traveling or not sure if a place is cash
only. Example: Excuse me, do you accept
credit cards? Translation: Please don't
make me dig for coins.
Four, I'm just looking. Thanks. Use this
when a super enthusiastic shop assistant
comes your way. Hi, can I help you? You
I'm just looking. Thanks. While quietly
calculating how much you can actually
afford.
Five. Can I pay in installments?
Perfect. If something's pricey and you
want to break it into smaller payments.
Example, can I pay in installments or is
it full payment upfront?
Six. Sorry, I can't afford it. This
one's honest and humble. Example, I'd
love to join the trip, but I just can't
afford it right now. Disappointed, but
real.
Seven. That's a good deal. When you do
find something awesome and affordable,
celebrate it. Example, only $5 for this.
That's a good deal. Excited.
Eight. Can I get a receipt, please?
Helpful when you're buying something
important or if your accountant, aka
your mom, needs proof. Example, can I
get a receipt, please? Nine. Can I get a
discount? A classic, especially when
you're in a market or store that's open
to negotiation. Example, if I buy two,
can I get a discount? Spoiler alert, it
works more often than you'd think. 10.
Do you have anything cheaper?
Another great one when you want to be
smart with your money and still get what
you need. Example, this is a bit out of
my budget. Do you have anything cheaper?
All right. Now we're talking like real
shoppers, budgeters, and money managers.
These are the phrases you'll hear
everywhere. And now you know how to use
them with confidence and charm. And hey,
speaking of real conversations, it's
time to put all this into practice. Up
next, I've got some mini dialogues for
you to listen to and repeat so you can
hear how these phrases actually work in
everyday situations like shopping,
paying bills, and yep, those slightly
awkward money talks with friends. In
this first dialogue, you'll hear two
friends figuring out how to pay the bill
after lunch. It's super common and a
great chance to learn how to talk about
splitting the cost using cards and
sounding totally natural. Let's listen
in.
All right. Are you paying or am I
treating us today?
H how about we split it? It's only fair.
We both ate like champions.
True. I'm totally fine with going half
and half. Teamwork, right?
Exactly. Do you have cash or card?
Card. I haven't seen actual cash in like
three months. You
same here. I'll just pay the full bill
now and you can transfer me your half
later. Sound good?
Perfect. I'll send it as soon as we
leave. What's the total?
It's $28 for everything. So, $14 each.
Not bad at all. Honestly, that chocolate
lava cake alone was worth the $14,
right? I'd seriously come back just for
that dessert. Like, forget the main
course.
Agreed. Next time we skip straight to
dessert and coffee.
Deal. But next time you're picking up
the tab.
Fair enough. Just don't order two
desserts again.
Okay, that felt real, right? We've all
been in that moment. The bill shows up.
There's a little pause and someone goes,
"So, who's paying?" Let's go over a few
gold phrases from that convo. Let's
split it and half and half. Supernatural
ways to say, "Let's share the cost." Do
you have cash or card? Simple, but so
useful in real life situations.
I'll pay now, you can transfer me later.
polite, practical, and something friends
say all the time. And don't forget, pick
up the tab. A fun idiom that just means
pay the bill. So, yeah. Now, when that
moment comes and the waiter drops off
the check, you'll know exactly what to
say. No awkward fumbling needed. All
right, ready for the next dialogue? In
this next dialogue, we're heading into a
situation that might make some people
nervous, returning something to a store.
Maybe it didn't fit. Maybe you changed
your mind. Either way, you're about to
learn exactly how to ask for a refund,
sound polite, and handle the whole thing
like a confident English speaker. In
this dialogue, you'll hear two friends
talking through how to return an item
and ask for a refund using clear,
polite, and totally natural English.
Let's listen. Okay, I have to return
this jacket.
I don't know what I was thinking. It
looked cute in the store, but now it
just feels weird.
Buyer's remorse kicking in big time. I
mean, I liked it under those fancy store
lights, but when I tried it on at home,
total nope. Then there. Do you still
have the receipt? Yep. Still in the bag.
Tags on, unworn, all good. I think I
have like 14 days to return it usually.
Did you pay with cash or card? card. I
checked. They accept returns for a full
refund as long as it's within two weeks.
I'm still within the window. Nice. So,
you're good to go. Are you just going to
ask for a refund straight up? Yeah. I'll
probably say something like, "Hi, I'd
like to return this. Can I get a
refund?" Clear and polite, right?
Totally. And if they ask why, just be
honest. Didn't fit. changed your mind,
whatever. Most places don't even ask.
True, but if they offer store credit
instead, I'll take it. I actually saw a
hoodie I liked more anyway. You're such
a professional shopper. Return one
thing, buy another. Hey, I call it smart
financial management. Right. Next thing
you know, you'll be teaching personal
finance.
Exactly. Lesson one, never cut the tags
until you're 100% sure. Okay, confession
time. How many of you have bought
something, gone home, and immediately
thought, "Why did I buy this?" Yep, me
too. More than once. This dialogue was
packed with helpful phrases for those
moments when you need to return an item
and ask for your money back without
sounding rude or awkward. Let's break it
down. Buyers remorse. I love this
phrase. It means feeling regret after
buying something you probably didn't
need. It's super common and very
natural. I still have the receipt and
tags on unworn. These are important
details when returning stuff. Stores
often need proof of purchase and want
the item in good condition. I'd like to
return this. Can I get a refund? This is
the golden phrase of the whole
conversation. It's clear, polite, and
totally appropriate in any store. I paid
with card and I'm still within the
return window. These are phrases that
help explain your situation. super
helpful if you're returning something
and want to sound confident and
prepared. And of course, the casual chat
around store credit, shopping swaps, and
smart spending. That's real English
you'd hear between friends all the time.
So now, if you ever need to return
something, you'll know exactly what to
say and how to say it without breaking a
sweat. All right, deep breath. We've
covered a ton already, but don't go
anywhere. We've got a quick quiz coming
up next to test how much you remember.
Let's do this. All right, my friend.
It's quiz time. Don't worry, this is the
chill kind. No grades, no pressure, just
a fun little check to see how much you
picked up today. I'll ask you three
quick questions and I want you to say
your answers out loud if you can or just
think them in your head like a confident
money genius. Ready? Let's go.
Question one. What's a natural way to
say let's each pay half the bill? Is it
A. Let's break the money.
B. Let's split it. Or C, let's tear it
in half. The answer is B. Let's split
it. Super common, super useful, and
totally stress-free.
Question two. If you feel regret after
buying something you didn't need, what
do we call that feeling? Is it A buyer's
delight, B shopping hangover,
or C buyer's remorse? The answer is C,
buyer's remorse. Don't worry, we've all
had it, even over snacks.
Question three, which phrase would you
use if you want your money back at a
store? Is it A, I demand justice,
B, can I get a refund,
or C, I paid, now I panic? The answer is
B, can I get a refund? Polite, clear,
and way more effective than yelling.
How'd you do? Three out of three. Two
out of three and feeling awesome. Even
if you missed one, it's all good. The
fact that you're still here means you're
learning and that's what really matters.
Now, stick around because up next, we'll
do a quick review and I've got a little
challenge for you, too. Let's keep it
rolling. Okay, deep breath. You've
learned a lot today. Let's take a quick
look back at all the money magic we just
covered. We started with basic money
vocabulary like cash, coins, bills,
cost, and change. Then we moved into
action verbs like earn, spend, save,
borrow, and refund. All the things we do
with money besides watching it
disappear.
After that, we jumped into idioms and
phrasal verbs like break the bank,
splash out, cut back on, and pick up the
tab. Because, you know, English can't
resist a weird phrase with zero logic.
Then we learn some practical phrases for
real situations.
Asking about prices, splitting the bill,
asking for a receipt, and more. And of
course, we had two awesome dialogues.
One at a restaurant, figuring out how to
split the cost with a friend, and one
about returning an item and asking for a
refund like a pro.
Honestly, you're crushing it. Now, I've
got a little challenge for you. Are you
ready? Your mission, if you choose to
accept it, write a short dialogue, just
four or five lines using at least two
money related phrases or idioms we
talked about today. It could be about
buying something, returning it,
budgeting with a friend, or begging your
roommate to pay the Wi-Fi bill. I'm not
judging.
And just like that, boom, you're
officially richer in English vocabulary.
See what I did there? Richer money
episode. Okay. Okay, I'll stop.
Seriously though, if you made it all the
way to the end, give yourself a big high
five. You've learned practical phrases,
money idioms, how to survive a bill
splitting moment, and how to ask for a
refund without sweating through your
shirt. That's a win. If you enjoyed this
episode, don't forget to hit that like
button, subscribe if you haven't
already, and share this with a friend
who always says, "Wait, how much was it
again?" And hey, leave a comment with
your favorite money phrase or a time you
accidentally spent too much on something
totally unnecessary. No judgment. I once
spent $30 on a scented candle I never
lit. It happens. Thanks for hanging out
with me and I'll catch you in the next
episode. Until then, keep learning, keep
laughing, and keep speaking English with
confidence. You've got this. Bye for
now.
Hey, hey. Welcome back to English
Phrases Hub. I'm Emma. If you're someone
who wants to speak English with more
confidence, more ease, and actually
enjoy the process, you're in the right
place. In today's episode, we're going
to talk about something super simple,
but also super powerful.
How to practice English every single
day. Even if you've got a busy schedule,
even if you feel a little shy, even if
you don't live in an English-speaking
country,
so many learners think they need to move
to the UK or America to speak fluently.
But nope, that's not true. You don't
need to live in London. You don't need
perfect grammar and you don't need to
study for hours every night. What you do
need are small, smart, and realistic
steps that fit into your everyday life.
And that's exactly what we're going to
talk about. I'll be speaking slowly and
clearly so you can follow along and even
repeat after me. So, get comfy, grab a
cup of tea or go for a walk, whatever
works for you, and let's jump into it
together.
All right, so let's talk about something
that a lot of English learners hear
about but maybe don't totally
understand.
Shadowing.
Now, if that word sounds a little
mysterious,
don't worry. You're not alone. Some
learners have heard of it before and
others are like, "Shadowing? What's
that?" So, here's the deal. Shadowing is
one of the best ways to improve your
speaking and listening at the same time.
And guess what? It's super simple.
Here's how it works. You listen to
someone speaking English like me right
now and then you try to repeat exactly
what I say as soon as you hear it like
an echo or like a shadow following right
behind.
You don't stop. You don't translate. You
don't overthink it. You just copy the
sound, the rhythm, the tone, the speed,
almost like you're acting in a little
English play. Let's actually try it
together right now. Ready? I want to
speak English fluently.
Now you say it. I listen to English
every day. Go ahead, give it a try.
Shadowing helps me speak better.
One more time. Your turn. Awesome.
That's shadowing. Now, listen. I know it
might feel a bit strange at first,
especially if you don't understand every
word. And honestly, that's totally okay.
Shadowing isn't about being perfect.
It's about training your brain and your
mouth to work together in English. It
helps you get used to how English
sounds, how it flows, and how it feels
to speak it. If you practice even just
five minutes a day, you'll start to
notice big changes. Your pronunciation
gets sharper. you speak faster and more
naturally, and most importantly, you
feel more confident. So, if you haven't
tried shadowing yet, this is your sign
to start. And don't worry, I'll be right
here to guide you through it.
Okay, so let's get real for a second. A
lot of English learners tell me the same
thing. Emma, I want to practice English
more, but I just don't have time. Or I
get nervous when I try to speak. Or
even, I don't know where to start. Sound
familiar? If you've ever felt like that,
first of all, you're not alone.
Seriously, so many people feel this way.
And second, I've got good news for you.
You don't need to study English for
hours every night. You don't need to
memorize hundreds of grammar rules. You
don't even need a fancy teacher or a
special course. What you do need are
small, simple steps that fit into your
actual real life. So, today I'm going to
share with you five easy ways to
practice English every single day, no
matter how busy you are or where you
live. And these aren't boring study
tips. These are fun, practical things
you can do anytime, anywhere. You ready?
Let's jump into tip number one. All
right, tip number one is super
important. And honestly, it's where
everything begins. Listen to English
every single day. Yep. Every day. Not
just once a week, not just in class.
Every day. Because here's the thing. If
you want to speak English better, you've
got to hear more English first, it's
like feeding your brain the sounds, the
rhythm, the natural flow of the
language. And don't worry, this doesn't
mean you need to sit at a desk with your
headphones for hours. You can listen
while you're walking, cooking, cleaning,
driving, or even just lying on the
couch. You can try podcasts like this
one, English music, YouTube videos,
short stories, or even English news made
for learners. And guess what? You don't
need to understand everything. Even if
you get 30% or 50%, that's still
amazing. Your ears are learning. Your
brain is noticing patterns. So just let
English become the background music to
your day.
Now, once you're listening, it's time to
use your voice. Tip number two is shadow
what you hear. You've probably heard me
talk about shadowing already, but let's
go a little deeper. Shadowing means
repeating what you hear right after you
hear it, like a shadow or like you're
echoing the speaker. So for example, if
I say I'm learning English every day,
you repeat, I'm learning English every
day. Try to match my voice, the speed,
the rhythm, even the emotion. It's okay
if you're not perfect. It's okay if you
miss a word. That's totally normal. The
point is to get your mouth used to
moving in English to train your brain
and your voice to work together like a
team. Just a few minutes a day can make
a huge difference. And trust me, the
more you do it, the more natural it
feels. Okay, this one's kind of a game
changer. Tip number three, start
thinking in English. even just one small
thought at a time. Now, I know what you
might be thinking, but Emma, my brain
automatically thinks in my native
language. Totally normal, but with a
little practice, you can start to shift
that. Start small. When you wake up, say
in your head, it's morning. I'm sleepy.
I need coffee.
Later, walking down the street. The
weather is nice.
I see a cat.
I'm going to the store.
You don't need full conversations, just
simple thoughts. And then when you feel
ready, try whispering them out loud.
It's like having a tiny English chat
with yourself.
No pressure, no translation, just you
and your thoughts in English.
Tip number four, read out loud. Yep. Not
silently, not just in your head, out
loud.
Why? Because this helps your brain, your
mouth, and your tongue work together,
like a little English workout for your
speaking muscles. You can read a simple
story, a children's book, a short
article, or even a transcript from a
video or podcast.
Start slow, then read it again, a little
faster, then again with feeling like
you're acting.
Pretend you're reading it to a friend or
like you're on stage. Have fun with it.
This builds your fluency, your
pronunciation, and most importantly,
your confidence.
Okay, tip number five is my favorite.
Make English a part of your daily life.
Not just something you study, but
something you live with. Let me explain.
You don't need to wait for a perfect
time to sit down and learn English.
Instead, just sprinkle English into the
little moments of your day, like this.
Change your phone's language to English
so you see English every time you unlock
it. Write a tiny diary at night. just
two or three sentences about your day.
Record a short voice message. Talk about
what you did, how you feel, or what you
learned.
Join an English group online, a WhatsApp
chat, a Facebook group, or a language
exchange app. Watch short English
videos, Tik Toks, reals, YouTube shorts,
and repeat the phrases you hear. You
don't need a classroom. You don't need
to travel to London or New York. You
just need to turn small everyday moments
into English practice. That's how
fluency grows, one tiny habit at a time.
So, there you have it. Five real simple
ways to practice English every single
day. And remember, it doesn't have to be
perfect. It doesn't have to be fancy. It
just has to be consistent.
Make English part of your life, part of
your morning, your thoughts, your phone,
your voice. The more you live with
English, the more it becomes natural.
And when that happens, speaking won't
feel like a struggle. It'll feel like
you. You've got this. And I'll be right
here with you every step of the way. And
that's a wrap for today's episode.
We covered a lot, didn't we? But
remember, you don't need to do
everything all at once. Just pick one
small thing and try it today. Maybe
shadow a sentence. Maybe change your
phone language. Maybe think one thought
in English before bed. Small steps
really do add up. And hey, if today's
episode helped you or even just made you
feel a little more motivated, I'd love
to hear from you. You can leave a
comment, send me a message, or even
record yourself trying one of the tips
and tag me. I'd be so happy to cheer you

Thanks for spending this time with me.
Keep learning, keep practicing, and most
of all, keep going. I'm Emma, and I'll
see you in the next episode. Bye for
now.
Hey, hey. Welcome back, my friend. It's
Emma here, and you've just clicked on
one of the most powerful and inspiring
stories we've ever shared here on
English Phrases Hub.
Let me ask you something. Have you ever
felt stuck,
like no one could hear you or understand
you?
Now imagine this. You can't see. You
can't hear. You can't speak. The world
is silent, dark,
isolated.
Most people would give up, but not Helen
Keller.
Today's story is about how one young
girl who couldn't see, hear, or speak
found a way to learn, to communicate,
and to inspire millions.
She became an author, a speaker, and a
fighter for human rights, even when the
world told her it was impossible.
And here's the best part. While you
listen to her story, you'll also be
learning real English, useful
vocabulary,
natural phrases and expressions that you
can use in everyday conversations.
The story will be told by our friend
Jake slowly and clearly, so it's perfect
for both beginner and intermediate
learners.
After the story, we'll have a fun little
quiz to test your understanding, and
then we'll review the most important
vocabulary and phrases to help it all
stick. So, get comfy, grab your notebook
if you'd like, because you're about to
hear a story that could change the way
you see the world and the way you learn
English. Let's begin the incredible
journey of Helen Keller.
Let's go back to the year 1880
to a small town in Alabama
in the United States.
That's where a baby girl named Helen
Keller was born.
At first, everything seemed normal.
She was a happy baby, full of energy,
always smiling.
But then something happened.
When Helen was just 19 months old, she
got very sick.
Doctors believe it was probably scarlet
fever or menitis.
She survived the illness, but when it
was over, everything had changed.
Helen could no longer see and she could
no longer hear.
Imagine that for a second.
You're not even 2 years old.
The world goes completely dark,
completely silent.
No more colors, no more voices.
Not even your mother's touch makes sense
anymore.
That was Helen's world.
She was still alive but trapped inside
herself.
She couldn't speak. She couldn't
understand others.
And no one could understand her.
She would cry, scream, and even hit
things.
She was frustrated.
She wanted to communicate but didn't
know how.
Her parents didn't know what to do. They
loved her deeply but they were afraid.
They wondered, "Will our daughter ever
learn?
Will she ever speak or even understand
us?"
But even in the silence, even in the
darkness, Helen was watching, feeling,
and thinking.
She was waiting for something or someone
to help her unlock her voice.
And that someone was coming soon. Helen
was now 6 years old.
still deaf,
still blind,
and still trapped in a world she didn't
understand.
Her parents were desperate to help her,
so they searched for answers.
And finally they found someone.
Her name was Anne Sullivan,
a young woman just 20 years old.
She had poor eyesight herself
and had gone through many struggles
growing up.
But Anne was strong,
patient,
and full of hope.
She believed that Helen could learn
if she just had the right teacher.
And so Anne moved into the Keller home.
From day one, it wasn't easy.
Helen didn't trust her.
She was wild, angry,
and out of control.
But Anne didn't give up.
She began teaching Helen a new language,
not with sounds or books,
but by spelling words into the palm of
Helen's hand.
She would take Helen's hand and press
the letters one by one.
For example, for the word doll,
an would put a doll in Helen's hand and
then spell d o l l
into her other hand.
At first, Helen memorized the signs, but
didn't really understand what they
meant. To her, it was just shapes and
movements
until
something incredible happened.
One day, Anne took Helen outside to the
water pump.
She placed Helen's hand under the
flowing water
and with her other hand she spelled the
word
w a t e r
again and again.
And then something clicked.
Helen's face lit up. She finally
understood
the cold liquid on her hand had a name.
It was water.
For the first time, she realized that
everything around her had a name. The
world wasn't silent anymore.
It was full of meaning.
Helen began touching everything and
asking for its name.
Pump, cup,
mother,
flower.
That was the moment,
the breakthrough.
The door had opened and Helen Keller was
ready to learn everything.
After that magical moment at the water
pump, Helen was unstoppable.
She wanted to learn everything and Anne
Sullivan was by her side every step of
the way.
Helen started learning hundreds of new
words. She learned how to read using
Braille, a system of raised dots that
you can feel with your fingers.
She learned how to write using a special
typewriter.
And believe it or not, she even learned
how to speak.
Yes, speak.
It wasn't easy. She couldn't hear her
own voice. So, every sound took time,
effort, and patience.
But Helen had something stronger than
sight or sound.
She had determination.
She studied hard. She practiced every
day. She made mistakes and kept going.
And eventually she did something almost
no one thought was possible.
She went to college.
Not just any college. She attended
Radcliffe College, one of the best in
the country.
And in 1904,
she graduated with honors, becoming the
first deaf blind person in the world to
earn a university degree.
Can you imagine
reading with your fingers, writing
without seeing, learning without hearing
a single word? But Helen did it because
learning gave her something powerful.
A voice. A voice she would use to speak
to the world.
After college, Helen Keller could have
lived a quiet, private life.
She had already achieved more than
anyone expected.
But Helen wasn't done.
She knew her story wasn't just about
her.
It was about everyone who had ever felt
invisible,
unheard,
forgotten.
So she made a decision.
She would use her voice not to complain
but to change the world.
Helen became a public speaker, writer
and activist.
Yes, she stood in front of large crowds
speaking clearly and confidently
even though she couldn't hear the sound
of her own voice.
She gave speeches across the United
States and around the world.
She met with presidents,
prime ministers,
and even royalty.
She spoke with Albert Einstein.
She became friends with Mark Twain.
She inspired millions.
But what did she speak about?
Helen didn't just talk about disability.
She spoke about justice,
equality,
and freedom.
She fought for the rights of people with
disabilities,
but also for women's rights, for
education,
and for peace.
She believed that no one, no matter
their body, background, or ability,
should be left behind.
She worked with organizations
to help the blind and deaf.
She raised money.
She wrote 14 books and hundreds of
essays and letters.
Her most famous book was called The
Story of My Life, which has inspired
generations of readers,
including probably you and me.
And Helen kept working well into her
70s.
She never let her challenges define her.
Instead, she used them to connect with
others,
to build bridges,
to open hearts.
People often asked her, "How can you
stay so positive when you've lived in
darkness and silence for so long?"
and she would smile and say something
like, "Although the world is full of
suffering, it is also full of the
overcoming of it."
That's Helen Keller.
A woman who couldn't hear or see, but
who helped the world listen more deeply
and see more clearly.
Wow,
what a journey, right?
From a little girl who lived in silence
and darkness to a woman who spoke to the
world, Helen Keller's life is more than

Now, are you ready to review some of the
most useful vocabulary and expressions
from today's story?
Let's jump into it. One,
deaf blind.
This means a person who can't hear and
can't see.
Imagine living in silence and darkness.
It's a huge challenge.
But today's story showed us that even
someone who is deafb blind can achieve
amazing things.
Example,
Helen Keller was deaf blind, but she
still became a writer and speaker.
Two, sickness.
This is when your body isn't feeling
well, like when you catch a cold or have
a fever. In Helen's story, her sickness
changed her life.
Example,
after the sickness, she lost her hearing
and sight.
Three, trapped.
If you're trapped, it means you can't
get out. Like being stuck somewhere or
even stuck in your own mind.
Helen felt trapped because she couldn't
communicate with the world.
Example,
she was trapped in silence with no way
to express herself.
Four,
frustrated.
We feel frustrated
when something is really hard and we
don't know how to fix it. Helen felt
this way a lot as a child. Example,
she got frustrated
because nobody could understand what she
wanted.
Five. Palm. Your palm is the inside part
of your hand where your fingers connect.
Helen's teacher used her palm to teach
her how to communicate.
Example,
Miss Sullivan spelled words into the
palm of Helen's hand.
Six. Keep going.
A simple but powerful phrase. It means
don't give up. Even when things are
hard, just keep going.
Example,
she kept going even when people told her
it was impossible.
Seven, full of meaning.
When something is full of meaning, it's
not just nice, it's deep. It has a
purpose or strong emotion behind it.
Example,
her words were full of meaning. They
touched people's hearts.
Eight. Breakthrough moment.
This is the moment when everything
changes.
When something finally works or you
understand something clearly.
Helen's breakthrough moment came when
she connected the word water to the cool
liquid in her hand.
Example,
that was her breakthrough moment. The
first time she truly understood a word.
Nine.
Word by word.
This means learning something slowly,
step by step. In Helen's case, she
learned language word by word.
Example,
she built her vocabulary
word by word with the help of her
teacher.
10.
Build bridges.
This phrase means creating understanding
between people, connecting hearts,
cultures or communities.
Helen helped build bridges between the
deaf blind community and the world.
Example,
her work helped build bridges between
the deaf blind community and the world.
Wow, those phrases really speak volumes,
don't they? And here's the best part.
You can start using them right away in
your conversations, in your writing, or
even in your journal. They're not just
English phrases. They're tools to
express real thoughts and real emotions.

Hey, hey.
Welcome back to English phrases Hub, the
place where we learn English through
real powerful stories.
Today, I've got one that's going to move
you. It's the story of a brave girl. A
girl who stood up when everyone else
stayed quiet, who spoke out even when it
was dangerous, and who believed with all
her heart that every child deserves a
chance to go to school. Her name Malala
Yusf Zai.
We're heading to a beautiful valley in
Pakistan where Malala was born. But her
world wasn't always peaceful.
In her town, girls weren't always
allowed to go to school. But Malala, she
loved learning. She loved books. She
dreamed of being a doctor someday. and
she believed that education is a right,
not a luxury.
So, in today's episode, you're going to
hear Malala's story. And along the way,
you'll pick up new English words, real
life phrases, and maybe even a little
inspiration.
And now I'm handing it over to Jake,
who's going to tell you the story in
slow, clear English so you can follow
every word, learn naturally, and enjoy
the journey. Ready? Let's get into it.
Malala was born in the year 1997
in a town called Mingora
in the Swat Valley of Pakistan.
It was a beautiful place with mountains,
rivers, and green trees.
But life was not always easy. Especially
for girls
in her country, many girls were not
allowed to go to school.
Some families thought girls should stay
at home. Only boys need education.
But Malala's father was different.
His name was Zeadin Yusf Zi.
He was a teacher.
He loved books and he believed that
girls and boys should be treated the
same.
He opened a small school and he welcomed
everyone,
boys and girls.
Malala grew up in that school.
She listened to lessons.
She read books. She learned to speak in
public even as a child.
She was smart. She was curious and she
loved to learn.
From a very young age, Malala knew
something was wrong with the world
around her.
She saw that some people had power and
some did not.
And she believed that education was the
key to change. As Malala grew older,
things started to change in her town.
A group called the Taliban came to Swat
Valley.
The Taliban were very strict.
They told people what to wear, what to
say, even what to think.
They did not want girls to go to school.
They said girls should stay at home.
Girls should not learn.
They used fear to control people.
They shouted. They destroyed schools.
They even hurt teachers who supported
girls education.
Many people were afraid.
Even some schools closed.
But Malala was not afraid to speak.
She started writing a blog using a fake
name.
She wrote about her life and how it felt
to be a girl who wanted to learn.
She said things like, "Why are girls not
allowed to go to school? This is not
fair."
Her words were powerful.
And many people around the world began
to listen.
Malala became a voice for many girls,
especially those who could not speak.
But speaking out was dangerous.
And soon the Taliban knew her name. It
was a normal school day.
Malala was 15 years old.
She was riding the school bus with her
friends.
They were laughing, talking just like
any other teenage girls.
But suddenly the bus stopped.
A man climbed on.
He was holding a gun.
He looked around and asked, "Who is
Malala?"
No one said a word, but some girls
looked at her.
And in that moment, the man knew.
He pointed the gun and he shot her.
Malala was hit in the head.
Two other girls were hurt, too.
Everyone screamed.
The bus driver drove fast to get help.
For many days, people thought Malala
would not survive.
She was taken to a hospital in Pakistan,
then flown to a bigger hospital in
England.
Doctors worked day and night to save
her. And slowly Malala woke up.
She couldn't speak at first. She
couldn't walk.
But her spirit was still strong.
She was still Malala.
And the world was watching. Malala
stayed in the hospital for many weeks.
She had surgeries.
She had therapy to help her walk and
speak again.
It was a hard time. But Malala was
strong and something amazing happened.
People from all over the world sent her
letters and gifts.
Children drew pictures.
Teachers wrote notes.
Leaders from many countries said, "We
are with you, Malala."
She was no longer just a girl from
Pakistan.
She became a symbol of courage, a symbol
of the fight for education.
And even after being shot, Malala did
not stay silent.
She said, "They tried to silence me, but
nothing changed in my life except this.
Weakness, fear, and hopelessness died.
Strength, power, and courage were born.
Malala began to speak at schools and on
big stages.
She talked about peace. She talked about
children. And she talked about why every
girl deserves to learn. Malala kept
speaking.
She spoke on TV.
She spoke at schools.
She spoke at big world events.
In 2013,
she gave a famous speech at the United
Nations.
She stood in front of world leaders and
said, "One child, one teacher, one book,
and one pen can change the world."
People stood up and clapped for her.
Some had tears in their eyes. She was
only 16 years old.
In 2014,
something incredible happened.
Malala won the Nobel Peace Prize, the
highest award for peace in the world.
She was just 17 years old, the youngest
person to ever win it. She didn't win
because she was famous. She won because
she was brave,
because she believed in education for
all
and because she never gave up.
Malala became a symbol, a symbol of
hope, courage, and the power of one
voice. Today, Malala is still speaking
out. She lives in the United Kingdom.
She went to Oxford University
where she studied philosophy and
politics.
She also started the Malala Fund, a
charity that helps girls around the
world go to school.
Malala travels to many countries.
She meets girls in villages, refugee
camps, and cities.
She listens to their stories and helps
give them a voice.
She says, "I tell my story not because
it is unique, but because it is not."
Malala is no longer just a girl from
Pakistan.
She is a global leader.
But she is still kind,
still calm, and still full of hope.
Her message is simple.
Education is not a luxury.
It is a right for every child
everywhere.
And that's the story of Malala Yusf Zai,
a true example of courage, strength, and
the power of education.
If you made it all the way to the end,
I'm so proud of you. You just listened
to a full English story, and that's a
big achievement.
Now, let's talk about how you can use
this story to really improve your
English.
First, try listening to the story again,
but this time repeat some of the
sentences out loud. That's called
shadowing, and it helps you sound more
natural. Second, pause and write down
new words or phrases you learned. Use
them in your own sentence or tell a
friend about Malala's story in your own
words. That's how real progress happens.
Little by little, story by story.
All right, quiz time. Let's see how much

Hm. Remember this one.
Answer. He was a teacher. He also ran a

This part was very emotional.

One story at a time. All right, ready to
dive into some powerful words and
phrases from today's story? We're going
to start with 10 key vocabulary words
from Malala's story. Simple, important,
and super useful.
Then we'll go over 10 strong phrases
that you can use in everyday English. No
pressure at all. It's just you and me
here learning together. I'll explain
each word in a really easy way and I'll
give you a quick example so you know how
to use it.
One, education.
Okay, so this one's a big deal in
Malala's story. Education is all about
learning. Going to school, reading,
asking questions, growing your brain.
Malala loved education. She believed
every kid should get to learn, not just
some.
Example,
Malala believed that every child should
have the right to an education.
Two, inspire.
Have you ever heard a story that made
you want to be better? That's what it
means to inspire someone, to give them
hope or motivation.
Malala's story, super inspiring.
Example, Malala's story inspires
millions of girls around the world.
Three rights.
These are the things all people should
have like the right to learn, to feel
safe, to be treated fairly. They're not
gifts. They're basic.
Example, going to school is a basic
human right. Four, equality.
This means everyone gets the same
chance. No one is more important. Girls,
boys, rich, poor, all equal. Malala and
her dad believed deeply in this.
Example, Malala's father believed in
equality between boys and girls. Five,
recover.
After something bad happens, like
getting sick or hurt, you need time to
heal. That's recover. It's like getting
your strength back. Example, after the
attack, Malala had to recover in a
hospital for many weeks. Six. Threat.
This one's a little scary. A threat is
something that could hurt you. Malala
faced real threats just for speaking
out, but she didn't stop. Example,
speaking out was a threat to Malala's
safety, but she kept going. Seven, Nobel
Peace Prize. Okay, this is a big one.
It's a huge honor. Like the world
saying, "Thank you for making the world
better." And Malala, she got it at just
17.
Example, Malala won the Nobel Peace
Prize when she was just 17 years old.
Eight. Fund. This is like a group or
organization that gives money to help
people. Malala started one to help girls
go to school. Pretty cool, right?
Example. Malala started a fund to help
girls go to school. Nine. Deserve. If
you deserve something, it means you've
earned it. You worked hard or just
because you're human. Like how every
child deserves an education.
Example. Every child deserves a chance
to learn. 10. Curious.
If you're curious, you love asking
questions, exploring, learning new
things. Malala was super curious. She
always wanted to know more. Example,
Malala was always curious. She loved
asking questions and learning new
things. Awesome job. You didn't just
learn 10 new words. You actually learned
how to use them. Now, here's a little
challenge. Pick one of those words and
use it in a sentence today. Say it out
loud. Write it down. Make it yours.
That's how we grow.
Now, let's switch gears a little. Words
are great, but you know what really
makes your English sound natural?
Phrases.
Real life expressions.
These are the things native speakers say
all the time. And guess what? You've
already heard some of them in Malala's
story. So, in this next part, I'll walk
you through 10 super useful phrases and
expressions, ones you can actually use
in daily conversations.
All right, ready to sound more natural
in English? Let's do it.
One, stand up for what's right.
This means doing the right thing even
when it's hard. Malala stood up for
girls education even when others were
too scared to speak. You can use this
when someone defends someone or
something good. like she stood up for
what's right even when her friends
didn't agree.
Two, speak out.
To speak out means to talk openly about
something that's unfair or wrong. It's
not just talking. It's using your voice
for a reason. Malala spoke out when
girls were being told to stay home.
Example,
he spoke out against bullying at school.
Three, find your voice. This is one of
my favorites. Finding your voice means
discovering your confidence, learning to
say what you believe. Malala found her
voice through writing and speaking. like
after years of being shy, she finally
found her voice and started sharing her
ideas.
Four, risk one's life.
This one is serious. If you risk your
life, you're doing something dangerous,
something that could hurt you because
you believe it's worth it. Malala
literally risked her life to speak out.
Example, firefighters risk their lives
every day to save others.
Five, against all odds.
This means something happened even
though it seemed impossible.
Malala surviving, recovering, and then
changing the world. Yeah. Totally
against all odds. like she graduated
college against all odds even after
dropping out once.
Six, fight for a cause. To fight for a
cause means to stand up for something
you believe in, like education,
equality, or peace. Malala fought for a
cause she believed in with her whole
heart. Example, they're fighting for a
cause. clean water for their village.
Seven, bounce back.
Love this one. To bounce back means to
recover after something bad happens,
just like a ball bouncing up after it
hits the ground. Malala was seriously
hurt, but she bounced back stronger than
ever. Like, she had a tough year, but
she bounced back with a fresh start.
Eight, stand tall.
This doesn't mean just good posture. To
stand tall means to be proud, confident,
and unafraid, especially when facing
pressure or criticism. Malala stood tall
even after the attack. Example, even
when people doubted him, he stood tall
and believed in his work. Nine. Go
through hard times. We all know this
one. To go through hard times means to
experience something difficult like
loss, pain, or struggle. Malala went
through some really hard times and still
stayed strong. Like our family went
through hard times last year, but we're
doing better now. And number 10, believe
in yourself. Ha, the classic, but still
so true. To believe in yourself means to
trust that you can do it even when
others don't. It's exactly what Malala
did from the start. Like, don't give up.
Believe in yourself. You're capable of
more than you think. Hey, great job
today. We just went through 10 super
real powerful expressions that you can
actually use when talking about life
challenges or even just to encourage
someone. Now, here's the fun part. Try
picking your favorite one and use it.
Say it out loud in front of the mirror.
Drop it into a text message or just
write your own sentence with it. That's
how your English gets better. one phrase
at a time. All right, that's a wrap for
today's episode. You listened to a real
inspiring story. You picked up new words
and expressions, and you learned how to
use them in everyday English. That's not
nothing. That's real progress. So,
seriously, give yourself a little high
five. You showed up. You listened. You
learned. And that's how it happens. Step
by step, story by story.
Here's your little challenge for today.
Pick one word or phrase from this
episode and actually use it. Say it,
write it, make it your own. Because
here's the thing, learning English
doesn't have to be all textbooks and
grammar rules. It can be real,
emotional, human, just like the story
you heard today.

powerful stories.
Today's story is about a young girl from
France. She was poor. She was just a
teenager.
But she changed history.
Her name was Joan of Ark. At only 17
years old, she led an army and defied an
empire.
She said she was guided by God. Many
believed her, others feared her, and in
the end she paid the highest price.
But today she is remembered as a hero
and a saint. In this episode, you will
hear the story in simple English, learn
new vocabulary and phrases,
take a short quiz to check your
understanding, and review some powerful
vocabulary and expressions you can use
in real life. Are you ready? The story
will be told by Jake in slow and clear
English, perfect for English learners.
Let's begin our story.
Joan of Ark, the girl who defied an
empire.
This story takes place a long time ago,
over 600 years ago in a country called
France.
At that time, France was in trouble.
There was a long terrible war between
France and England. It was called the
Hundred Years War.
Many towns were burned, many people were
hungry, and many were afraid.
In a small village in Eastern France
lived a young girl named Joan.
She came from a poor farming family.
She did not go to school. She could not
read or write.
But Joan was kind. She worked hard and
she had a strong heart.
When Joan was 13 years old, something
strange happened.
She said she began to hear voices,
holy voices,
voices of angels.
The voices told her, "You must help the
prince of France.
You must help save your country."
Most people would be afraid, but not
Joan.
She believed the voices and she believed
in herself.
At just 13 years old, Joan felt her life
had a purpose.
And that purpose was to save France. As
Joan grew older, the voices became
stronger.
They came often.
They gave her clear instructions.
They said, "Go to the prince. Help him
fight.
You will lead the army.
You will save France.
Joan was now 16 years old. She was
young, but she was brave.
She decided to follow the voices.
She went to a local leader. She said, "I
need to see the prince. God has sent
me."
At first, they laughed at her. "She's
just a girl," they said. "She's only a
farmer's daughter."
But Joan didn't give up. She kept
asking. She kept believing.
Finally, one commander said, "Let her
try."
He gave Joan a horse and some guards and
she traveled many days to reach the
prince.
When Joan met the prince, she looked him
in the eye and said, "God sent me to
help you. I will lead your army and we
will win."
The prince was surprised,
but something about Joan felt special.
She spoke with passion, with confidence,
with faith.
So the prince said yes. He gave Joan
armor, a sword, and an army.
She was just 17 years old. and soon she
would become one of the most famous
leaders in French history.
Joan put on armor like a real soldier.
She carried a flag and a sword. She rode
a horse.
And she led her soldiers with strength
and faith.
The army's first goal was to help the
city of Orlon.
The city was surrounded by English
soldiers.
People were starving.
They were losing hope.
Many thought Joan's army would fail.
They said, "She's just a girl. What can
she do?
But Joan was not afraid.
She rode at the front of the army. She
gave strong speeches.
She prayed. She believed.
Her courage gave the soldiers hope. And
then a miracle happened.
In just 9 days, Joan's army won the
battle. The English soldiers ran away
and the people of Orlon were saved.
The news spread fast. A teenage girl
saved the city.
The French soldiers started to believe.
The people started to believe.
They called her the maid of Orlon.
She was now a symbol of faith, hope, and
victory.
But Joan's mission was not finished yet.
She had one more goal. To help the
prince become king.
After the victory in Orlon,
Joan became famous across France.
People said, "She is sent by God. She is
our hero."
But Joan had one more mission. She
wanted the prince to be crowned king.
In those days to become king, a prince
had to be crowned in a special city
called Rimes.
But there was a problem.
Rhymes was far away and the road was
full of enemy soldiers.
Many people told Joan, "It's too
dangerous. You can't go."
But Joan said, "We must try. This is
God's plan."
So once again, Joan rode with the army.
They passed through town after town, and
the people cheered for her.
The English soldiers didn't stop them
and finally they reached Rhymes.
In the great cathedral, the prince was
crowned King Charles I7th.
Joan stood beside him. Her eyes were
full of tears.
She had done what the voices asked. She
had helped save France.
But Joan's story was not over. A dark
chapter was still to come. After the
king's coronation,
Joan wanted to keep fighting.
She wanted to free all of France from
English control.
But something had changed.
The king had powered now. He didn't
listen to Joan as much. He didn't give
her the same support.
Still, Joan continued.
She led more battles. She tried to
protect towns and people.
Then one day in the city of Compia,
Joan was surrounded by enemy soldiers.
She tried to escape, but they caught
her. These soldiers were not English.
They were Burgundians,
French allies of the English.
They took Joan as a prisoner and soon
they sold her to the English.
Joan was now 18 years old. She had no
army, no support, and the king she
helped did nothing to save her. She was
taken to the city of Ruan.
There she would face her greatest
battle, but this time not with a sword,
with her words. Joan was now a prisoner
of the English.
They wanted to punish her, but not for
fighting. They wanted to hurt her
reputation.
So they put her on trial, a long unfair
trial.
They called her a heretic,
someone who goes against the church.
They said she was lying about the
voices. They said she was evil.
They even said wearing men's clothes is
a crime.
Joan stood alone.
There were no friends, no lawyers, no
one to protect her.
But Joan was still strong.
She said, "The voices came from God. I
followed what I believed was right."
The trial lasted for months.
The judges asked hard questions.
They tried to trick her.
But Joan answered clearly and bravely.
Even her enemies were surprised by her
words.
Still the judges made their decision.
They found her guilty
and they said she must be executed.
Joan was just 19 years old. It was May
30th, 1431.
The morning was cold and quiet.
Joan was led to a public square in the
city of Ruon.
She was tied to a wooden pole.
A large fire was built beneath her.
Many people came to watch.
Joan was calm. She looked up at the sky.
She called out, "My voices did not lie.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."
And then the fire was lit.
Joon of Ark was burned at the stake. She
was just 19 years old.
People cried. Even some of her enemies
felt shame. They knew she was not a
witch. She was not evil. She was brave.
Years later, the church said the trial
was wrong. They cleared her name. In
1920,
Joan was made a saint by the Catholic
Church.
Today she is a symbol of courage, faith
and standing up for what is right. Her
story is told in books, in schools, in
movies all around the world.
She was a poor girl with no power, but
she believed. She spoke up and she
changed history.
That was the story of Jon of Varc, the
girl who defied an empire.

Great job. If you got three or more
correct, you're doing amazing.
If not, don't worry. You can always
listen again and learn more each time.
All right, my friend. Let's take a few
moments to go over some of the most
important and useful vocabulary and
phrases from today's story.
These are expressions you can actually
use in real life conversations.
I'll say each one slowly, explain it in
a simple and easy to remember way and
give you a short example to help you
really understand it. Feel free to pause
and repeat after me if you'd like to
practice. Ready? Let's start with the 10
key vocabulary words and then we'll move
on to the 10 key phrases.
Let's dive in. One, empire.
So, an empire is like a big group of
countries ruled by one powerful leader,
kind of like a super country.
In our story, the English Empire was
fighting to control parts of France.
Two, peasant.
A peasant is someone who's really poor
and works on a farm. Back in Joan's
time, most people were peasants. No
money, no school, just hard work every
day. Joan. She was one of them.
Three. Vision.
A vision is like a dream you see when
you're awake. Joan said she saw visions
of angels telling her what to do. Not
everyone believed her, but she believed
in herself.
Four. Crowned.
This one's easy. To be crowned means to
officially become king or queen. And
guess what? Joan helped the prince get
crowned. That's a big deal.
Five.
Heresy.
Okay, this word sounds heavy. Heresy
means believing or saying something that
goes against church rules. Joan was put
on trial for heresy because she said God
was speaking to her. Six, betray.
To betray someone means to break their
trust or give them to the enemy.
That's exactly what happened to Joan.
She was betrayed by people who were
supposed to protect her.
Seven. Saint. A saint is someone the
church says lived a very holy and good
life.
Years later, the church said, "Oops,
Joan was innocent." And they made her a
saint.
Trial.
All right. A trial is like a big serious
meeting in court. It's where people
decide if someone is guilty or innocent.
In Joan's case, she had a trial because
people said she was a heretic. But
honestly, it wasn't fair at all. They
already made up their minds before it
even started.
Courage. Now, this is one of my favorite
words. Courage means being brave, even
when you're scared. Joan had huge
courage. She stood in front of armies,
judges, and even death. And she didn't
run away. She believed in her mission
and never backed down.
Divine.
This one's a little deeper. Divine means
something that comes from God or from a
higher power. So when Joan said her
voices were divine, she meant they came
from heaven and she trusted them with
all her heart. And there you go. That's
10 strong vocabulary words from today's
story.
Now let's switch it up a bit.
Words are great, but phrases
phrases are what make your English sound
natural, real, and alive.
So, in this next part, I'll walk you
through 10 super useful phrases.
These are expressions you can actually
use when speaking, just like native
speakers do. They come straight from
Joan's story, but trust me, you can use
them in everyday life, too. All right,
ready for phrase number one? Let's do
this.
One, stand up for what you believe.
This means to speak out or take action
for what you think is right, even when
it's hard. Joan stood up for her beliefs
even when people laughed, doubted her,
or wanted her gone. And guess what?
That's real strength.
Two, never give up. You've probably
heard this one before, but it's always
worth repeating. To never give up means
to keep trying no matter how tough
things get. Joan didn't stop. Not when
they doubted her, not when they captured
her. That's next level determination.
Three, risk one's life.
This means doing something dangerous
where you could actually die for a cause
or person. Joan risked her life every
time she rode into battle. She knew the
danger. She went anyway.
Four, make a difference. To make a
difference means to help change
something for the better. Even if you're
just one person like Joan, you can still
change the world around you, and that's
powerful.
Five, find your way. This can mean
figuring out where you're going in life
or in a real place. Joan found her way
by listening to her inner voice and
walking her own path. We're all finding
our way, aren't we? Six, follow your
heart.
This means doing what you truly feel is
right, even if it doesn't make sense to
others.
Joan followed her heart, not what people
told her she should do, and that's what
gave her purpose.
Seven, a voice for the voiceless.
This phrase means to speak up for people
who can't speak for themselves.
Joan gave hope to the poor, the scared,
and the forgotten.
She became their voice. And that's
beautiful.
Eight. Keep going.
Short and simple, but so powerful.
It means don't stop. Just keep moving
forward.
Even when Joan was tired, even when she
was alone, she kept going.
Nine. Light at the end of the tunnel.
This is a metaphor for hope after a hard
time.
France was in darkness during the war,
but Joan became the light at the end of
the tunnel.
Things finally started to change.
10. Go the extra mile.
This means to do more than what's
expected.
To give your full effort.
Joan didn't just do what she was asked.
She gave her heart, soul, and strength.
She truly went the extra mile. We've

Hey there and welcome to English phrases
hub. I'm Emma and today I have a true
and powerful story to share with you. A
story of hope, hunger, and a boy with a
big dream.
Imagine this.
You're 14 years old. Your country is in
a drought. Your family has no food,
no money,
no electricity,
and you're forced to leave school.
But instead of giving up, you open an
old science book and decide to build a
windmill.
Sounds impossible, right? Well, that's
exactly what one boy did. His name is
William Kamwamba.
And he lived in a small village in
Malawi, Africa with nothing but junk,
courage, and a book. He built something
that brought light and hope to his
people.
This episode is part of our series,
Learn English through Real Stories. So,
while you listen, you'll also learn new
English words and phrases,
simple sentence structures,
natural pronunciation, and real life
inspiration.
Don't worry if English is still new for
you. Jake and I will speak slowly and
clearly to help you understand.
At the end of the story, I'll go over
the most important words and phrases
with you step by step. So, get ready to
be inspired. Now, let's begin the story.
Here's Jake with the true story of the
boy who harnessed the wind.
William Kamwa
was born in a small village in Malawi, a
country in Africa.
He lived with his mother, father, and
six sisters.
His family were farmers.
They grew corn and used the food to
live.
They didn't have much money, but they
worked hard and lived simply.
Then in 2001,
something terrible happened.
There was a drought. It didn't rain for
many months. Without rain, the corn
could not grow.
Soon there was a famine.
That means there was not enough food.
People were hungry and many were sick
and scared.
William's family ate only one small meal
a day. Sometimes they had nothing at
all.
The famine became so bad that William
had to leave school. His parents could
not pay the school fees anymore.
William was only 14 years old. He was
sad. He loved learning. But now there
was no food, no school, and no hope.
Even though William couldn't go to
school anymore, he didn't stop learning.
He was curious. He always wanted to
understand how things work.
Near his village, there was a small
library.
It had only a few books, but William
loved to go there.
One day he found a science book called
Using Energy.
The book was in English and William
didn't speak English well.
But the book had pictures and William
looked at them closely.
There was one picture that changed
everything.
It showed a windmill.
The book said that a windmill could
create electricity.
It could power lights. It could even
pump water.
William had never seen a real windmill
before. But in that moment, he had an
idea.
He thought, "What if I build a windmill
and bring electricity to my home?"
Everyone else was trying to survive, but
William was dreaming of solutions.
He didn't have money. He didn't have
tools, but he had an idea and he was
ready to try. William had a big idea,
but no money, no tools, no teachers, no
internet, just one science book, a
strong mind, and a lot of hope.
So he started with what he had. Every
day he walked to the junkyard near his
village.
He looked for old, broken things, parts
that other people threw away. He picked
up old bicycle parts, a broken tractor
fan, pieces of wood and bamboo, wires,
bolts, and plastic pipes. To others, it
was just trash, but to William, it was
everything he needed.
People in the village saw him digging in
the garbage. They laughed and said,
"This boy is crazy. He thinks he can
build something from trash." Even his
mother was worried. She asked, "Why are
you wasting your time?" But William
didn't stop. He believed in his idea. He
believed that he could change something.
He worked outside every day. He used a
small hammer. He tied things with rope
and wire. He looked at the pictures in
the book again and again. It took many
weeks.
Finally, he built a tall tower from wood
and bamboo.
At the top, he placed his homemade
windmill with blades made from plastic
and a dynamo from an old bicycle.
Then he waited.
One windy afternoon, the blades began to
turn
slowly at first, then faster and faster.
William connected the wires to a small
light bulb in his house and for the
first time ever his house had light. The
windmill worked. His parents were
shocked. His neighbors were amazed and
the people who laughed now stood quietly
watching the blades spin in the wind.
This boy who had dropped out of school,
who had nothing but a book and a dream,
had brought electricity to his home. And
this was just the beginning. William's
windmill was more than just a machine.
It was a light in the darkness.
At first, it only powered a small light
bulb in his room. But for William and
his family, it felt like magic. They
could finally see at night. They didn't
have to use dangerous candles or
kerosene lamps anymore.
Next, William connected the windmill to
a radio.
For the first time, they could hear
music and news from the world.
Then he used it to charge a mobile
phone, something that seemed impossible
before.
News of the boy who built a windmill
spread through the village. People came
from far away just to see it. They
couldn't believe it. A 14-year-old who
had dropped out of school had created
electricity from junk.
Some people asked him for help. They
wanted windmills, too. They asked him
how he did it. And William helped them.
He started to build a second windmill,
even bigger, to pump water for farming.
Now families could grow food again, even
during the dry season.
Williams invention brought more than
just light. It brought hope. It showed
people that one person, even a child,
can make a big difference.
His windmill didn't just turn in the
wind. It turned people's hearts toward
new ideas, learning, and possibility.
Williams windmill changed his village,
but soon it would change his life.
A group of journalists visited his
village. They saw the windmill and they
were amazed.
They took pictures. They wrote about
William's story.
That story spread across Malawi, then
across Africa, and then to the whole
world.
People were shocked. A boy with no
money, no teacher, no internet, had
built a windmill from trash.
In 2007,
Williams was invited to speak at a big
event in Tanzania.
It was called TED Global. People from
all over the world came to listen.
It was William's first time on a plane,
his first time outside his country. And
when he walked on stage, he was nervous.
But he stood up and said, "I tried and I
made it." The audience stood and
clapped. Some even cried.
After that, everything changed.
William received a scholarship to finish
school. Later, he went to college in the
United States.
He learned more about science and
engineering.
He also wrote a book about his life.
It's called The Boy Who Harnessed the
Wind. The book became famous.
It was even made into a movie on
Netflix.
But even with all this success, William
never forgot his village.
He returned to Malawi and continued to
help.
He worked on projects to bring solar
power, clean water, and education to
more people.
William's story went from a small
village to the entire world.
And his message was simple.
With a little hope and a lot of effort,
anything is possible.
William's story is not just about a
windmill.
It's about believing in yourself,
even when no one else does.
He had no money.
He had no teacher.
He had no tools,
but he had an idea
and he had the courage to try.
Many people laughed at him.
But he didn't give up.
He kept learning.
He kept building.
He kept dreaming.
And because of that, his idea turned
into something real, something powerful,
something that helped many people.
So, what can we learn from William?
Don't wait for perfect conditions.
Start with what you have.
Don't be afraid to try.
Even if you fail, you'll learn something
new.
One small idea can grow and it can
change not just your life but the lives
of others too.
William Chemwamba once said, "Trust
yourself and believe.
Whatever happens, don't give up."
And that's a lesson we can all carry
with us in English, in life, and in
every dream we chase.
Wow, what an amazing story, right? Thank
you so much for listening all the way to
the end of today's episode. I hope you
enjoyed the story of William Kamw
Kwamba, a young boy with no money, no
electricity, and no school, but with a
big dream and the courage to follow it.
His story shows us that we don't need to
be rich or famous to make a difference.
We just need to believe in ourselves,
keep learning, and never give up. And
while you listened, you also practiced
English. You learned new words, simple
sentence patterns, and real expressions
used in storytelling. That's the power
of learning through stories. It's not
just about grammar or rules. It's about
real language, real feelings, and real
life. So, give yourself a big well done.
All right. Now, let's do a quick quiz to
check your understanding of the story.
I'll ask you five questions. You can
pause the video after each one and try
to answer out loud. Don't worry if
you're not sure. Just try your best.
Let's begin. Quiz questions. One, where
is William Kimwa from?
Two, why did William have to leave
school?
Three, what book gave him the idea to
build a windmill?
Four, what kinds of materials did he use
to build it?
Five, what happened after he gave his
TED talk?
Now, let's go over the answers together.
I'll repeat each question and then give
the correct answer. Let's see how you
did.
One, where is William Kimwa from? The
answer is he is from Malawi, a country
in Africa.
Two, why did William have to leave
school? The answer is his family
couldn't pay the school fees because of
the famine. There was no food and no
money.
Three. What book inspired William to
build a windmill?
The answer is a book called Using
Energy. It had pictures of a windmill
which gave him the idea.
Four. What kinds of materials did he use
to build his windmill?
The answer is he used old bicycle parts,
plastic pipes, wood, wire, and a broken
fan all from the junkyard.
Five. What happened after William gave
his TED talk? The answer is his story
spread around the world. He got a
scholarship, finished school, wrote a
book, and even had a movie made about
his life.
If you got most of them right, amazing
job. If you missed one or two, no
problem at all. You're learning, and

So, relax and enjoy the story. Let's
begin.
This is a true story.
It happened a long time ago in the
United States of America.
It is the story of a brave woman.
Her name was Harriet Tubman.
She was born into slavery.
That means she was not free.
She had to work very hard.
She had no rights.
But Harriet was not afraid.
She escaped from slavery.
Then she went back again and again to
help other people escape too.
She became a hero.
She changed the lives of many.
She showed us the power of courage,
kindness, and never giving up.
But to understand Harriet's strength, we
must go back to the beginning.
Let's look at Harriet's early life.
Harriet Tubman was born in the year
1822.
She was born in the state of Maryland in
the United States.
Her name at birth was Aramea Ross.
Later she changed her name to Harriet
after her mother.
Harriet was born into slavery.
Her family were slaves too.
They were not free.
They worked for other people and they
were not paid.
As a child, Harriet worked very hard.
She worked in the fields.
She cleaned houses.
She took care of babies,
but she was often treated very badly.
She was beaten many times.
One injury caused her lifelong pain.
Sometimes she would suddenly fall
asleep.
This happened all her life.
But Harriet was strong.
She learned from her mother and father.
They taught her about faith, hope, and
the dream of freedom.
As Harriet grew older, her dream to
escape became stronger.
And one day, she made a very brave
choice.
Harriet Tubman was now a young woman.
She had worked hard for many years.
She had seen pain, sadness, and cruelty.
She saw her family suffer, too. Her
brothers, sisters, mother, and father.
They were all slaves.
Harriet wanted something different. She
wanted freedom.
She wanted to live her life in her own
way. She wanted to be safe. She wanted
to be free.
In the year 1849,
Harriet heard something frightening.
She might be sold to a different slave
owner far away from her family.
This was the final moment.
She said to herself, "I will run away. I
will find freedom. I will not wait."
One night, she left. She told no one.
She walked alone in the dark. She could
not take a bag or food. She could not
make a sound.
If someone caught her, they could punish
her or worse.
Harriet followed the North Star.
She knew the star would lead her to the
free states.
She traveled through forests, rivers,
and fields.
She was cold. She was hungry.
But she never turned back.
Along the way, some kind people helped
her. They gave her food, water, and a
place to rest.
These people were part of a secret
network called the Underground Railroad.
They believed slavery was wrong. They
helped people like Harriet escape.
After many days, Harriet reached the
north.
She was finally free.
She could walk in the sunlight. She
could speak without fear. She could
choose her own path.
But Harriet was not only thinking about
herself.
She missed her family. She missed her
friends. She knew many people were still
in slavery.
Harriet had found freedom, but she knew
she had to go back. She had to help
others escape, too.
This is where her mission truly began.
Harriet Tubman was finally free. She had
reached the north. No one could own her
now. No one could tell her what to do.
She could have stayed there. She could
have lived a quiet, safe life. But
Harriet could not forget the people she
loved. Her mother, her father, her
brothers, her sisters.
All of them were still slaves.
All of them were still suffering.
So Harriet made a brave and dangerous
decision.
She would go back to the south. She
would help her family escape. And not
only her family, she would help anyone
who wanted to be free.
But how could she do it? She was just
one woman and the South was full of
danger.
Slave catchers were everywhere.
There were laws that said escaped slaves
must be returned.
Anyone helping slaves could be arrested
or even killed.
Still, Harriet went back. She became a
part of something very special, the
Underground Railroad.
It was not a real train. There were no
tracks. There were no tickets. It was a
secret network.
It was made of safe houses and brave
people.
These people hated slavery.
They wanted to help. Harriet was called
a conductor. She led people from one
safe place to the next. She knew when to
hide. She knew when to move. She was
smart, quiet, and strong.
She traveled at night. She used the
stars to guide her. She listened to the
wind and the woods. She followed the
rivers. She sang songs, but not just for
music. Her songs had secret messages.
They told others when it was safe to
move or when danger was near.
She carried a small bag with food and
water. Sometimes she carried a revolver
to protect her passengers and to make
sure no one gave up or turned back. Each
trip was full of fear, but Harriet
stayed calm.
She never lost a person.
Every man, woman, and child she led
reached freedom.
People began to whisper her name, Moses.
Like the prophet from the Bible who led
his people out of slavery in Egypt.
Harriet Tubman made about 13 trips back
to the south. She helped more than 70
people escape and she gave advice to
help hundreds more.
Each time she went back, the danger grew
bigger, but her courage grew stronger.
She once said, "I never ran my train off
the track and I never lost a passenger."
She became a symbol of hope, a true
hero, a voice for the voiceless, a guide
in the night.
But Harriet's journey was not finished.
Her bravery would take her even further
into the heart of a war. By now, Harriet
Tubman was known as a hero. She had made
many dangerous trips to the south.
She had helped over 70 people escape
slavery.
She had never been caught and she had
never lost a passenger.
But Harriet's courage didn't end there.
In the year 1861,
everything changed. A big war started in
the United States. It was called the
Civil War.
The country was divided into two sides.
The North called the Union, the South
called the Confederacy.
The South wanted to keep slavery.
The North wanted to stop it. So they
went to war.
It was a sad and violent time.
Families were torn apart. Soldiers were
dying. The future of the country was not
clear.
Harriet knew she could help.
She was not a soldier, but she had
something powerful,
bravery, knowledge, and experience.
She joined the Union Army.
At first, she worked as a nurse. She
cared for sick and injured soldiers.
She used natural plants and herbs to
make medicine. She cleaned wounds. She
gave comfort. Many soldiers said she
saved their lives.
But soon the army saw that Harriet could
do more. She knew the South. She knew
the land, the roads, and the forests.
She could speak quietly, move quickly,
and stay calm.
So, she became a spy for the Union.
That means she went into enemy areas and
gathered important information.
She watched the enemy. She listened to
their plans.
She talked to people secretly.
Then she brought the information back to
help the Union Army.
It was very dangerous.
If she had been caught, she could have
been killed, but Harriet Tubman was not
afraid. In the year 1863,
Harriet led a military mission.
It was called the Kahi River raid.
This was a special operation.
Harriet worked with Union officers.
She helped plan the attack.
She helped guide boats through rivers
filled with traps and enemy guards.
That night they moved carefully and
quickly.
They attacked a group of plantations.
And the best part, they freed over 700
slaves in one night.
Harriet was the first woman in American
history to lead a military raid.
This was not just bravery.
This was leadership.
This was history.
After the raid, people were amazed.
Soldiers respected her. Leaders thanked
her. But Harriet did not want praise.
She said, "I was doing God's work."
She didn't fight with weapons. She
fought with her heart, with her faith,
and with her actions.
But even after the war, Harriet still
had more work to do. The war was over.
Slavery had ended.
Millions of people were now free.
Harriet Tubman had done so much.
She had helped people escape.
She had worked as a nurse, a spy, and a
leader.
She had changed lives.
She had changed history.
But Harriet did not stop
after the Civil War. Life was still hard
for many people,
especially for black Americans.
They were free, but they had no money,
no homes, and no schools.
Many people still treated them unfairly.
Harriet wanted to help.
She used the little money she had to
help people in need.
She opened her home to sick people and
older people.
She gave them food.
She gave them love.
She gave them hope.
She also worked for women's rights.
At that time, women could not vote.
Harriet gave speeches.
She told people that women and men
deserve the same rights.
She spoke with other leaders.
She told the story of her life.
She told people, "We are all equal.
We all deserve freedom."
Even though she was poor, Harriet gave
everything she had to others.
She lived a simple life.
She wore simple clothes,
but her heart was big.
She helped everyone she could.
In 1908,
a special place opened in her name.
The Harriet Tubman Home for the aged.
It was a home for poor elderly
Africanameans.
It was built on land she owned
and she lived there too in her final
years.
Harriet Tubman died in 1913.
She was about 91 years old.
Before she passed away, her last words
were, "I go to prepare a place for you."
She lived for others.
She gave her life for justice,
for peace, and for freedom.
Harriet Tubman was born into slavery,
but she chose freedom, not just for
herself, but for others. She led over 70
people to safety, helped during the war,
cared for the poor, and fought for equal
rights. Today, she is remembered as a
hero. Her name is honored in schools,
streets, and history books. She believed
in freedom, equality, and doing what's
right. You don't need to be rich or
famous. You just need to be brave.
Harriet Tubman followed the stars, broke
the chains, and became the voice of
freedom. Wow, what an incredible story.
Harriet Tubman showed us the meaning of
true courage. She was brave, strong, and
full of heart. She didn't just fight for

Lena was 17 years old. She lived in a
small town near the desert. The town was
quiet. Not many people had big dreams.
But Lena was different. She wanted to
fly.
Not in an airplane, not in a rocket.
She wanted to fly with something she
built.
Her father was an inventor. He died when
Lena was just a child, but he left
behind his tools, his notebook, and his
big ideas.
Every evening after school, Lena went to
the old garage. It was full of dust and
old machines.
But to Lena, it felt like magic.
She drew pictures in her notebook.
Wings, engines,
gliders.
She said to herself, "One day I will
fly. I will touch the sky."
Lena knew it would not be easy. She had
no money, no team, and no one really
believed in her. But that didn't stop
her. Not at all. Because when Lena
looked at the sky, she didn't see
clouds.
She saw a dream waiting for her. Lena
worked in the garage every day. After
school, after dinner, even late at
night. The garage became her second
home. She studied her father's notebook.
There were drawings of wings, notes
about wind and balance, ideas, dreams,
and numbers she didn't understand. But
Lena didn't give up. She went online.
She read books. She watched videos about
flight and gliders. She learned how
wings move through the air. She learned
how to build a model and test it. She
made a small glider from wood and
plastic. It flew across the yard. Just a
few seconds, but it flew.
Lena smiled. She was one step closer to
the sky, but she needed something
bigger. She needed to build a real
humanpowered glider. So, she saved her
money. She sold old parts. She fixed
bikes for neighbors. Bit by bit, she
bought the things she needed. Wood,
wires, glue, and fabric for the wings.
Some days were hard. The glue didn't
stick. The parts didn't fit. And once
everything fell apart. She sat on the
floor of the garage and cried, but only
for a minute. Then she stood up, wiped
her face, and said, "It's okay. I'll try
again."
Lena knew flying is not easy, but
dreaming is never useless.
And step by step, her dream began to
take shape. One morning, Lena walked to
school. The sky was clear. The sun was
warm on her face. The wind moved softly
through the trees.
She felt happy. She had worked late the
night before. She had finished the right
wing of her glider. It was a good day.
At lunch, she sat outside with her
notebook. She was drawing the tail of
the glider. Her hand moved quickly. She
felt focused, excited, alive.
Then she heard someone talking nearby.
A boy said to his friend,
"Hey, did you hear? They're going to
tear down the cliffs.
Lena looked up. She didn't understand.
What cliffs? She asked. The boy
shrugged. You know the ones near the
canyon. The city wants to build a new
factory there. They're starting next
month. Lena froze. Her hands stopped
moving. Her pencil fell. Her heart beat
faster. The cliffs. The cliffs were
important,
special.
They were her launch site, the only
place high and open enough to fly her
glider.
That evening, she didn't wait for the
school bell. She grabbed her bag and ran
all the way home. She opened the garage
door and stood there breathing hard. Her
glider stood in the center of the room.
It looked strong, beautiful, but it
wasn't finished. Not even close.
She sat down on the floor. She looked at
everything around her. The pieces of
wood, the tools, the mess, the sketches.
Her eyes filled with tears. "Why now?"
she whispered. "Why so soon?"
She felt angry, then scared.
Then something else, a quiet fire inside
her. She wiped her face, stood up, and
took out her notebook. She opened a
clean page. She wrote, "I have 30 days.
30 days to finish this glider, to test
it, to fly, to prove I can do it. Not
for them, but for me. I won't waste a
single minute."
From that moment, Lena changed. No more
waiting. No more tomorrow. She had a
deadline. and a dream.
Every morning she woke before the sun.
She worked before school. She worked
after school. She barely stopped to eat.
She fixed broken pieces. She tested
small parts in the yard. She read more.
She built faster.
She made mistakes.
But she kept going. Her hands were
tired. Her eyes were heavy. But her
heart was full of fire. Because now the
dream was not far. The dream had a time,
a place, a chance, and it was waiting
for her at the edge of the cliff. Lena
worked alone for many days. She liked
working by herself. She didn't want
help. She didn't think anyone would
understand.
But one afternoon, something changed.
She was carrying long wooden boards from
the shop. They were heavy. She was
walking slowly down the street. A boy
about her age saw her. He was sitting in
front of a small repair shop. He stood
up and said, "Do you need help with
that?" Lena looked at him. He had dark
curly hair, oil stained hands, and kind
eyes. She shook her head. I'm fine, she
said. He smiled. Okay, just thought I'd
ask. I'm Noah. He didn't push. He just
waved and went back inside. That night,
Lena thought about him. No one had
offered to help before. Not like that.
The next day, she passed by the same
shop. This time she stopped. "Hi," she
said. "I'm Lena. I'm building
something." "A glider."
Noah raised his eyebrows. "A glider?
Like something that flies?"
Lena nodded. "I have 25 days left to
finish it." Noah looked impressed.
"That's crazy," he said. "But I like
crazy. want a second pair of hands?"
Lena smiled. "Maybe."
That same week, another surprise
happened. At school, her science
teacher, Mr. Rahan, noticed her
drawings. She was sketching in class,
not taking notes. He walked over and
said, "That looks like a flight diagram.
Where did you learn that?"
Lena looked down, a little nervous.
I'm building a glider," she whispered.
Mr. Rahan didn't get angry. He smiled
and said, "Come see me after class."
Later in his small office, Lena showed
him her notebook. He turned the pages
slowly. His eyes widened. "This is
advanced work," he said. "Have you
tested airflow, wing angle, balance?"
Lena blinked. Some of it, she said. I'm
still learning. He nodded. Let me help.
I used to study aerodynamics.
I'll teach you what I know. From that
day on, Lena was no longer alone. Noah
helped with the tools and wood. Mr.
Rahan helped with the science and
planning. Lena still worked the hardest.
But now she had support. People believed
in her and that made her stronger. The
30 days passed quickly. Some days were
full of progress. Other days were full
of problems. But Lena kept going. Every
day, every hour. And now the glider was
finished. She looked at it in the
garage. Long white wings, strong frame,
balanced weight. It looked like
something from a dream, but it was real.
She had built it with her hands and her
heart. The night before the flight, Lena
couldn't sleep. She sat near the glider
and whispered, "Please fly." The next
morning, the sky was clear. The wind was
soft. The cliffs stood tall and quiet,
waiting.
Noah helped carry the glider up the
trail. It was heavy, but Lena's steps
were strong.
Mr. Rahan walked beside them, holding a
small notebook and stopwatch.
When they reached the top, Lena looked
down. Far below, the desert stretched
wide and empty. Everything was silent.
She checked the wings again. the
balance, the straps, the wind. Noah gave
her a thumbs up. Mr. Rayhon said softly,
"You've done your part. Now let the sky
do the rest." Lena stepped back, took a
deep breath, and ran forward.
Her feet left the ground. The glider
dipped, then caught the wind, and for a
moment, Lena flew. She flew over the
edge of the cliff, over the desert, over
the world. The air rushed past her face.
The wings held strong. She laughed, not
because everything was perfect, but
because it was real. After a few long
seconds, the glider began to lower
slowly, gently, safely. She landed in
the soft white sand below. No injuries,
no crash, just peace.
Lena looked up at the sky, smiling,
breathing hard. She had done it. She had
touched the sky.
And that's the end of the story to touch
the sky.

got some wrong, don't worry. The goal is
to learn, not be perfect. You can always
go back and listen to the story again.
And now, let's take a few minutes to
review some of the most useful
vocabulary and phrases from today's
story. To touch the sky.
These are words that you heard in the
story. And if you learn them in context
like this, they'll stay in your memory
much longer. So, let's begin. I'll say
the word, explain it simply, and then
give you an example sentence. You can
repeat after me if you'd like. Ready?
Glider.
A glider is a flying machine with no
engine. It moves through the air by
catching the wind like a big paper
plane. Example, Lena built a glider to
fly from the cliff.
Cliff. A cliff is a very high and steep
edge like a sharp drop at the top of a
mountain. Example, she launched her
glider from the top of the cliff.
Straps. Straps are strong bands that
hold something in place, like on a
backpack or a parachute.
Example, she tightened the straps before
running with the glider.
[Music]
whispered. To whisper means to speak
very quietly, often when you're alone or
when something feels emotional.
Example, she whispered, "Please fly,"
the night before her flight.
Launch. To launch something means to
start something, to send something off
into action. We use it for rockets or
gliders or even new ideas.
Example, she launched the glider by
running toward the edge.
Dream come true. A dream come true means
something you've always wanted finally
happens. Example, flying the glider was
Lena's dream come true.
Take a deep breath. This is something
you do when you're nervous or about to
do something big. You stop, breathe in
deeply, and prepare yourself.
Example, she took a deep breath before
her first flight.
Trail.
A trail is a path or small road, usually
in nature or the mountains. Example,
they carried the glider up the trail to
the top of the cliff. Wingspan.
The wingspan is the total length from
one end of a wing to the other. Example,
the glider had a wide wingspan like a
bird.
Support. To support someone means to
help them, stand with them or believe in
them. Example. Noah and Mr. Rayhon
supported Lena's dream.
Step by step. This means slowly, one
thing at a time, not all at once.
She built the glider step by step. Catch
the wind. To catch the wind means to
move with the wind's power, like a kite
or sail. Example, the wings caught the
wind and the glider lifted.
Beautiful, right? These words and
phrases didn't come from a textbook.
They came from a real story with real
emotion. So, try to remember them not
just as vocabulary, but as pieces of
Lena's journey, maybe pieces of your own
journey, too. And that's the end of
today's episode. You listened to a full
story in slow, clear English. You
answered questions to check your
understanding. And you learned some
powerful vocabulary and phrases along
the way. That's amazing.
Stories like this are not just for fun.
They're one of the best ways to improve
your English. You learn how words work
in context. You connect emotions to
meaning and you start to think and dream
in English. So, here's your challenge.
Try listening to this episode again
tomorrow. This time, shadow my voice.
Repeat the sentences. Feel the rhythm of
the story. That's how fluency grows day
by day. And if you enjoyed the story, I
would love to hear from you. Leave a
comment, share your favorite part, or
tell me what was your favorite
vocabulary word from today's episode.
And if you haven't already, make sure to
follow the podcast so you never miss a
new story. New episodes come out every
day, each one designed to help you feel
more confident, more natural, and more
connected to the language. Thanks again
for joining me, and as always, keep
listening, keep learning, and keep
believing in your voice. See you next
time.
There was a man named Daniel. Daniel
loved adventure. He was brave, strong,
and very focused.
Daniel had a dream. He wanted to climb a
great mountain. Not just any mountain,
but one of the highest, most dangerous
mountains in the world. His dream was
big and a little bit scary. But Daniel
was not afraid.
He believed in hard work. He believed in
pushing himself. He believed he could
reach the top alone.
Many people had tried to reach the top.
Some made it, some didn't. Daniel
trained for many years. He woke up early
every day. He ran through the hills near
his home. He practiced hiking. He
practiced climbing on smaller mountains.
He lifted heavy backpacks. He got
stronger and stronger. He read about the
mountain. He studied maps and weather
reports. He wanted to be ready.
One day, the time came. Daniel packed
his things carefully. Food, water,
ropes, warm clothes.
His friends were worried. They said,
"Daniel, don't go alone. It's too
risky." But Daniel smiled. "I need to do
this." He said, "It's my dream."
The day finally came. Daniel stood at
the base of the mountain alone, just him
and the mountain. The wind was cold and
snow fell gently from the sky. He looked
up. The top was hidden in clouds, but he
didn't feel afraid. He felt ready.
Step by step, he started to climb.
At first, it was easy. The path was
clear and the weather was calm. The sky
was blue and the sun was shining. The
mountain was quiet and beautiful.
Daniel smiled. He felt strong. He was
getting closer to the top. But as the
day went on, the weather began to
change.
Clouds covered the sky. The wind became
cold and fast.
Snow began to fall. His hands were cold.
His legs were tired. But he kept going.
He was tired but determined.
I can do this, he said. I've trained for
this. I won't give up.
Hours passed. The sky turned gray. Then
the sun began to set. Daniel looked
around. He was high above the ground
now. The trees below looked small. The
mountain was quiet. Only the sound of
the wind and the crunch of snow under
his boots. He found a narrow ledge and
decided to rest. He drank some water. He
checked his gear. The mountain was cold
but beautiful.
As night began to fall, Daniel looked up
once more. The top was still far away,
but he felt strong. "I can do this," he
whispered.
He didn't know that soon something
unexpected was coming. something that
would change everything.
Daniel continued climbing.
The wind howled across the mountain. The
snow was falling harder now. Each step
was slower than the last. He was high
up, maybe too high, but he didn't stop.
He was tired, cold, but he pushed
forward.
Then it happened.
As he stepped on a narrow ridge, his
boot slipped. The snow beneath him gave
way. And suddenly, he was falling. His
body dropped fast. He didn't scream. He
didn't have time. But then snap. The
rope around his waist caught him. It
pulled tight and Daniel stopped falling.
He was hanging
in the air.
Suspended by the rope. He dangled above
the ground. The wind blew snow into his
face. His arms shook. His legs kicked.
He couldn't see below.
Everything was dark. He had no idea how
far the ground was. It could be 2 feet
or 200.
He tried to climb the rope, but his
hands were frozen. He tried to look
down, but the snow and fog covered
everything. He was alone, completely
alone,
hanging in the cold, silent night.
His heart pounded in his chest. His
breath was fast and shallow.
Fear wrapped around him like the wind.
Daniel tried to stay calm. He told
himself, "I've trained for this. I have
my rope. I just need to wait.
Minutes passed. Then hours.
The cold was getting worse. His body was
shaking. He was losing feeling in his
fingers.
His mind began to wander.
He thought of his home, his family, his
friends.
He thought about how close he had come
to the top. and how quickly everything
had changed.
And for the first time in a long time,
Daniel felt afraid.
Daniel hung there in the dark. The rope
held his body, but his heart felt heavy.
The cold cut through his jacket. His
muscles were numb. His breath came out
in short clouds. Time was passing
slowly.
He closed his eyes. He whispered a quiet
prayer. Please help me. His voice was
soft, almost lost in the wind. Then
something strange happened. A voice,
clear, calm, strong, but not loud. It
came from the darkness, from the sky, or
maybe from inside his heart. The voice
said only three words.
Cut the rope.
Daniel froze. He opened his eyes. He
looked around but saw nothing. Only
snow, fog, darkness.
He thought he imagined it. He was tired,
cold, afraid.
Maybe it was just a dream. But then
again, the voice repeated. "Cut
the rope."
Daniel's heart raced. "No," he
whispered. "That's crazy. If I cut the
rope, I'll fall."
He waited, but there was silence. The
voice didn't explain. It didn't argue.
It just gave him a choice.
Cut the rope or hand on. Daniel thought
about it. He had trained for years. He
trusted his gear. He believed in
preparation and logic. And now a voice
was telling him to let go. He shouted
into the darkness, "Who are you? Why
should I trust you?" No answer. The wind
blew. The snow continued to fall, and
the rope still held him tight. Daniel
made his decision. He tightened his
grip. He held the rope with both hands.
"I won't let go." he whispered. I'll
wait. I'll survive. He didn't move. He
didn't sleep. He didn't cut the rope. He
just held on all night in the freezing
dark, waiting, trusting the rope, not
the voice. The night felt endless.
Daniel didn't sleep. He couldn't. His
body was too cold. His arms were too
tired. His mind was too full of
questions.
He stayed still, holding the rope,
hoping for light, hoping for rescue,
hoping for a miracle.
His thoughts came and went like waves.
Did I make the right choice?
Is the voice still out there? What if
I'm only a few feet from the ground?
He didn't know. He just held on because
that's all he knew how to do.
Then something changed. A soft light
began to grow in the sky. Very slowly,
the darkness faded into pale gray. The
sun was rising.
Daniel blinked. His eyes were tired. His
face was cold, but he could see just a
little. As the light grew stronger, he
looked down, and what he saw made his
heart stop. Below him was the ground.
Not far, not deep, not dangerous, just
solid white snow. Just safety.
Daniel was only two feet above the
ground. Just two. He could have dropped
safely. He could have let go. He could
have walked away, lived, survived.
But he didn't because he was afraid
because he didn't trust what he couldn't
see. Because the voice told him to let
go, but he didn't believe it. Daniel
closed his eyes. He felt a deep silence
inside his chest. A silence louder than
the wind. A silence full of realization.
He hadn't needed to hold on. He had
needed to trust.
Later that day, rescuers found him. His
body was cold, but he was still
breathing barely. They took him down the
mountain, wrapped him in warm blankets,
saved his life, but the lesson stayed
with him forever.
Sometimes in life, we hold on too
tightly. We are afraid to let go, afraid
to fall, afraid to trust something we
can't see.
But often we're much closer to safety
than we think. Closer to peace, closer
to a new beginning.
If only we would let go.
Wow, that was a powerful story. How did
it make you feel? Daniel held on because
he was afraid. He didn't trust what he
couldn't see.
But sometimes the safest thing we can do
is let go. This story isn't just about
mountains. It's about life, about fear,
about trust, and maybe about you.
Maybe there's something you're holding
on to, a worry, a decision, a fear of
change. But maybe you're closer to
safety than you think.
closer to peace, closer to a new
beginning, just like Daniel.
Now, I want to ask you, what did you
learn from this story? Would you have
let go or held on like Daniel? Tell me
in the comments. I'd love to hear your
thoughts. And now, let's talk about you
and how you can use this story to help
you learn English. When you listen to a
story in English, something amazing
happens. Your brain starts to understand
real language naturally. You learn new
words in context. You improve your
listening. And most of all, you feel
something. That emotion helps you
remember. So, I encourage you, listen
again. Repeat parts of the story out
loud. Notice the words, the tone, the
rhythm. The more you listen, the more
confident you'll feel. Now, let's see
how much you remember. We're going to do
a quick quiz. Just 10 simple questions
about the story. After each question,
I'll give you a few seconds to think or
say your answer out loud. This will help
you check your understanding and feel
proud of how much you've learned. And
after the quiz, don't go anywhere. We'll
do a vocabulary and phrases review to
help you remember some of the most
useful English from today's story. Are
you ready? Let's begin the quiz.
Question one. What was Daniel's dream?
The answer is to climb one of the
highest and most dangerous mountains in
the world.
Question two. Did Daniel want to climb
with other people?
No, he wanted to climb alone.
Question three. How did Daniel prepare
for the climb?
He trained for years running, hiking,
climbing smaller mountains, and studying
maps and weather.
Question four, what did his friends say
before he left?
They said, "Don't go alone. It's too
risky."
Question five. What happened when Daniel
was high on the mountain?
He slipped and fell, but his rope caught
him. Question six. Where was Daniel
hanging after the fall?
The answer is in the dark, high on the
mountain, hanging from his rope. He
couldn't see the ground.
Question seven. What did the mysterious
voice tell Daniel to do?
The answer is
cut the rope. Question eight. Did Daniel
listen to the voice?
The answer is no. He was too afraid.
So, he held on to the rope all night.
Question nine.
What did Daniel see in the morning?
The answer is he was only 2 feet above
the ground. Question 10.
What is the lesson of the story?
The answer is
sometimes we hold on because we're
afraid, but letting go and trusting the
unknown can lead us to safety, peace, or
something better.
Great job, my friend. You made it
through the quiz. If you didn't know
every answer, that's okay. Every time
you listen, you learn more. And the more
you review, the more it stays in your
mind. Now, let's look at some useful
words and phrases from today's story.
These are real English expressions that
you can hear and use in daily life. I'll
say the word or phrase, then I'll
explain what it means in simple English.
You can say it with me if you like.
Let's get started.
The first word is climb.
To climb means to go up, like going up a
mountain, a tree, or stairs.
Example,
Daniel wanted to climb a great mountain.
Next word, trust.
To trust means to believe something or
someone is safe or true even if you
don't see everything.
Example,
Daniel didn't trust what he couldn't
see.
Next word, let go. To let go means to
release something, to stop holding on.
Example, the voice said, "Let go." But
Daniel was afraid.
Next phrase, hold on. To hold on means
to keep holding something tightly,
especially when you're scared.
Example, Daniel decided to hold on to
the rope.
Next word, realization.
Realization means a sudden
understanding. When you finally see the
truth. Example, Daniel had a moment of
realization when he saw the ground.
You're doing great. Let's keep going.
Here's the next word. Afraid.
To be afraid means to feel fear or
worry. It's how we feel when something
is scary or unknown.
Example, Daniel didn't let go because he
was afraid.
Next word, voice. A voice is the sound
someone makes when they speak. Example,
Daniel heard a voice in the dark.
Next phrase, in the dark. In the dark
means without light, but it can also
mean not knowing what's happening.
Example, Daniel was hanging in the dark.
He couldn't see the ground.
Next word,
rescue.
To rescue someone means to save them
from danger.
Example, later rescuers found Daniel and
saved his life.
And one more real lesson.
A real lesson is not just something we
read in a book. It's something we learn
from life, from experience.
Example, the lesson stayed with Daniel
forever.
Well done. You've learned new words,
practiced phrases, and most importantly,
you connected with the story. The more
you listen and repeat, the stronger your
English becomes. So, keep listening.
Keep speaking and keep growing. And that
brings us to the end of today's episode.

Hey there and welcome to English phrases
hub. I'm Jake.
In today's episode, we're going to
listen to a short story in English.
The story will be told slowly and
clearly, perfect for beginners.
It's called A Day at the Park, and I'll
be narrating it just for you.
You'll hear every day English words and
phrases you can use in real life. You'll
listen, learn new vocabulary, and even
practice speaking, too. Here's what
we'll do today. First, we'll listen to
the story. Then I'll explain some useful
words and expressions.
And finally, you'll get a chance to
practice speaking on your own. We'll do
a method called shadowing. That means
you can pause the audio, repeat after
me, or even write down what you hear.
It's a great way to build your
confidence and improve your fluency.
So get comfortable. You can sit back and
relax or listen while walking or sipping
tea. Wherever you are, just take your
time. And remember,
fluency comes with practice, not
perfection.
Are you ready? Let's begin today's
story. A day at the park.
It was a sunny Saturday morning.
The sky was blue and the weather was
warm.
Emma decided to go to the park.
She packed a small bag.
Inside she put a water bottle, a book,
and a snack.
She walked to the park near her house.
It took about 10 minutes.
She smiled as she walked.
The sun felt nice on her face.
When she arrived, she saw many people.
Children were playing on the swings.
A man was jogging with his dog.
An old couple was sitting on a bench
talking and laughing.
Emma found a quiet spot under a big
tree.
She sat on the grass and took out her
book.
Birds were singing in the trees.
She felt peaceful.
She read for a little while. Then she
closed the book and looked around.
A boy's ball rolled near her feet.
She picked it up and gave it back to
him.
He said, "Thank you."
Emma smiled and said, "You're welcome."
After reading for a while, Emma started
to feel a little hungry.
She opened her bag and took out her
sandwich.
It was her favorite.
Soft bread, fresh cheese, and sweet
tomato slices.
She took a bite and smiled.
"M
just perfect," she whispered to herself.
While eating, she looked around the
park.
Two girls were riding their bikes,
laughing loudly.
One of them rang her bike bell. Ding
ding. Emma smiled.
A small white dog ran across the grass.
It was chasing a butterfly,
jumping and spinning in circles.
The butterfly flew higher and higher.
The dog barked but couldn't catch it.
Emma laughed quietly.
She loved these small moments.
They made her feel happy inside.
After finishing her sandwich, she drank
some water.
The cold water felt nice on a warm day.
Then she lay down on the soft grass and
looked up at the sky.
The clouds were big and fluffy.
One looked like a heart.
Another looked like a cat.
Another looked like a boat sailing
through the sky.
She closed her eyes and took a deep
breath.
Inhale.
Exhale.
The air smelled fresh like trees and
flowers.
She listened to the sounds around her.
Birds were singing.
The leaves moved gently in the wind.
A baby laughed nearby.
Emma felt peaceful.
She forgot about her phone.
She forgot about work.
She just enjoyed the moment.
Time passed slowly.
After maybe an hour, Emma sat up and
stretched her arms.
She stood up, brushed the grass off her
clothes, and picked up her bag.
Before leaving, she looked around one
more time.
The park was still full of life.
People smiled,
children played,
the world felt kind.
As she walked home, she felt light,
happy,
relaxed.
She said quietly to herself, "I should
come to the park more often." Emma
walked home slowly.
The air felt cooler now.
The sun was still shining, but it was
lower in the sky.
A soft golden color covered the
buildings and trees.
As she walked, she listened to the
sounds of her neighborhood.
Leaves moved in the wind.
A bicycle bell rang in the distance.
A baby laughed from a window above.
Emma passed by a flower shop. She
stopped and looked at the flowers.
Bright yellow sunflowers,
pink roses,
white lilies.
She smiled and thought, "Even small
things can make a day feel beautiful."
A neighbor, Mrs. Salma, was watering her
plants outside.
Emma waved and said, "Good afternoon."
Mrs. Salma smiled and replied, "Did you
enjoy the sunshine today?"
Emma nodded, "Yes, I went to the park.
It was lovely." They talked for a minute
or two. Then Emma continued walking.
She felt warm inside.
Not just from the sun, but from the
kindness of a simple hello.
When Emma reached her house, she opened
the door, took off her shoes, and
stretched.
She looked around her small home. It was
quiet, clean, and cozy.
She walked to the kitchen and made
herself a cup of tea. Hot mint tea with
a little honey.
Then she sat by the window.
The sky outside was turning orange and
pink. She watched the colors slowly
change.
The day was ending, but she felt calm,
happy, and full of light.
Emma opened her notebook, the one where
she sometimes wrote her thoughts. She
wrote, "Today, I didn't do anything big.
I didn't go shopping.
I didn't use my phone much.
I didn't work or study, but I felt
something I haven't felt in a long time.
I felt peace. The sun, the people, the
trees, the sky, all of them reminded me
that life is beautiful.
Sometimes we just need to stop and
notice it.
Then she drew a little picture. A tree
with a girl reading under it. A ball. A
sandwich. A small dog chasing a
butterfly.
Emma closed her notebook and smiled.
She whispered softly, "I should go to
the park again next Saturday."
And that was today's story.
A day at the park.
Now, let's take a moment to look at some
useful words and phrases from the first
part of our story.
I'll explain what they mean, give you an
example, and you can repeat after me.
Let's begin.
Phrase one.
It was a sunny Saturday morning.
This means the sun was shining and it
was the start of the weekend. A bright,
beautiful day.
Example,
it was a sunny Saturday morning, so we
went to the beach.
Now you try. Repeat after me.
It was a sunny Saturday morning.
One more time. It was a sunny Saturday
morning.
Phrase two.
She packed a small bag.
To pack a bag means to put things inside
it before going out.

Again, she packed a small bag.
Phrase three.

Swings are the seats at the playground
that move back and forth.

the swings after school.
Now say it with me. Children were
playing on the swings.
Again,
children were playing on the swings.
Phrase five.

removed her book from her bag. Example,
I took out my notebook and started
writing.
Repeat after me.
She sat on the grass and took out her
book.
Once more, she sat on the grass and took
out her book.
Great job.
These everyday phrases are simple,
useful, and easy to remember. Practice
saying them out loud.
Try using them in your own short story.
Now, let's look at some more useful
words and phrases from part two of our
story.
I'll explain what each one means, give
you an example, and you can repeat after
me to practice.
Let's get started.
Phrase one,
she took a bite and smiled.
To take a bite means to eat a small
piece of something.

coffee in the morning.
Repeat after me. She loved these small
moments.
One more time. She loved these small
moments.
Phrase three. She lay down on the soft
grass.
To lay down means to rest your body
flat. The soft grass means the ground
was gentle and comfortable.

grass and looked at the sky.
Repeat after me. She lay down on the
soft grass.
Again, she lay down on the soft grass.
Phrase four. The clouds were big and
fluffy.
Fluffy means soft and light, like a

wanted to hug it. Repeat after me. The
clouds were big and fluffy.
One more time. The clouds were big and
fluffy.
Phrase five.
She picked up her bag and smiled.

friend. Repeat after me.
She picked up her bag.
Again, she picked up her bag.
Well done. These simple phrases will
help you talk about everyday life in
English. Keep practicing and try using
them when you speak or write.
Now, let's move to explore the words and
phrases from the third part of our
story. Let's keep going. Now, let's take
a deeper look at some useful words and
expressions from part three of our
story.
These phrases can help you talk about
your feelings, your thoughts, and the
simple beauty in everyday life.
I'll explain the meaning, give you an
example, and then we'll say each phrase
together slowly.
Let's begin.
Phrase one, she felt warm inside.
This phrase describes an emotional
feeling, not a physical one. Warm inside
means you feel peaceful, happy, or
touched in your heart.
It's a gentle and positive emotion.
Example,
when I got a kind message from my
friend, I felt warm inside.
Let's say it together.
She felt warm inside.
Again, she felt warm inside.
One more time. She felt warm inside.
Phrase two.
She watched the colors slowly change.
This is about noticing something
beautiful and calm like a sunset or
nature. It means you are watching
something with care and attention and
seeing it transform gently over time.
Example,
at the beach, I watched the sky change
from blue to pink. I watched the colors
slowly change.
Repeat after me.
She watched the colors slowly change.
Again, she watched the colors slowly
change.
One more time.
She watched the colors slowly change.
Phrase three,
she wrote in her notebook.
This is a very useful phrase for talking
about daily habits, journaling, or
reflecting on your day.
Notebook can be used to write stories,
memories, or personal thoughts.
Example,
every night I sit down and write in my
notebook. It helps me feel calm.
Now repeat after me. She wrote in her
notebook.
again. She wrote in her notebook.
One last time, she wrote in her
notebook.
Phrase four,
even small things can make a day feel
beautiful.
This is a full sentence and a powerful
one. It reminds us that happiness can
come from simple moments like seeing
flowers or hearing a bird or talking to
a kind person.
Example, a smile from a stranger, a warm
cup of tea or a walk in the park.
Even small things can make a day feel
beautiful.
Let's say it slowly together.
Even small things can make a day feel
beautiful.
Again, even small things can make a day
feel beautiful.
One more time.
Even small things can make a day feel
beautiful.
Phrase five.
I want to go again next week.
This is a simple way to express a future
plan. It means you enjoyed something and
you're thinking about doing it again
soon.
Example,
that cafe was so nice. I want to go
again next week. Repeat with me. I want
to go again next week.
One more time.
I want to go again next week. And once
more.
I want to go again next week.
Now you have all five phrases.
You can use these phrases to talk about
daily things you enjoy and how you feel.
Excellent job. You've just learned how
to express feelings, describe calm
moments, and talk about future plans,
all in simple, natural English.
Remember, when you repeat phrases out
loud, your brain and mouth work
together.
That's how fluency begins to grow, one
sentence at a time.
Coming up next is your speaking
challenge. So stay with me and get ready
to practice your own English.
Now it's time for your speaking
challenge. This is your chance to
practice speaking English out loud, just
like you're having a real conversation.
Don't worry about being perfect. Speak
slowly, speak clearly, and most of all,
have fun with it.
You can pause this audio, repeat what I
say, or even write it down if you like.
Ready? Let's begin.
Part one, personal experience practice.
I'll ask a question, then I'll give you
a sentence starter. You can finish the
sentence in your own words. Here we go.
Question one.
What do you usually do on a sunny
Saturday?
Try this. On a sunny Saturday, I usually
Question two.
Have you ever gone to a park by
yourself?
Try this. One time I went to the park
and
question three.
What small things make your day feel
beautiful?
Try this. Even small things like
can make my day feel beautiful.
Take your time. You can always pause and
think. Now, let's move on to shadowing
practice.
Part two, shadowing practice.
Now, I'll say a sentence, you repeat
after me, just like an echo. This is
called shadowing, and it's a great way
to improve your pronunciation and
fluency.
Let's try it. Repeat after me.
It was a sunny Saturday morning.
She packed a small bag.
She lay down on the soft grass.
The clouds were big and fluffy.
Even small things can make a day feel
beautiful.
I want to go again next week.
Nice work. Now try saying them again,
but this time say them without listening
first. Challenge yourself to remember
the words and say them out loud on your
own. You can do it. And that's it for
today's speaking challenge.
The more you practice out loud, the more
natural English will feel. You're doing
great, and I'm proud of you for showing
up and speaking today. Keep going.
Rewind this part if you need more
practice and I'll see you in the next
episode. Until then, keep learning, keep
speaking, and keep growing. And that
brings us to the end of today's episode.

[Music]
Whoa, Lily, you okay? You look like a
balloon about to pop. Me? Oh, I'm great.
Totally fine. Completely chill. Nothing
weird happening. Nope. Lily, you only
talk that fast when you're hiding
something. What is it? Come on, spill.
No, I promised I wouldn't say anything
this time. Last time I opened my mouth,
chaos followed. Oh, you have to tell me
now. I'm curious. My brain is itchy with
mystery. Tom, you made me spill the
beans last week about Rachel's surprise
gift. She nearly threw a cupcake at me.
Yeah, but it was worth it. That was the
most exciting cupcake fight I've ever
seen. Oh, fine. But you absolutely
cannot tell anyone. Not your dog, not
your grandma, not your goldfish. Goldie
can't keep secrets anyway. She's a
terrible listener. Okay, Jessica is
planning a secret surprise party for Mr.
Parker's birthday this Friday. Oo, Mr.
Parker, our math teacher. Yes, she
booked a magician, got a singing cake
that changes color, and even made a
slideshow of his most boring math
quotes. That slideshow is going to be
legendary. What does the cake sing?
First, happy birthday, then Beyonce. The
cake literally sings Single Ladies. It's
amazing. Wow. I love this party already.
So, who else knows? Wait, what have I
done? I wasn't supposed to tell anyone.
Oh, no. I just let the cat out of the
bag again. Where? Where's the cat? Why
is it in a bag? And who put it there?
No, Tom. It's just an expression. Let
the cat out of the bag means I revealed
a secret by accident. Ah, got it. Still
disappointed, though. I like cats. This
is serious. If Jessica finds out I told
you, she'll make me wear a math costume
to the party. A math costume? Yep. She
has a giant pie symbol outfit. It's
horrifying. Okay, I promise I won't tell
anyone. I'll pretend I know nothing.
When that cake sings Beyonce, I'll just
be like, "Wow, what a surprise." Good.
And if anyone asks, you heard it from
the janitor. Perfect. Blame the janitor.
Classic move. Uh, next time just stop me
before I let any animal out of any bag.
Deal. But no promises if someone
mentions talking cupcakes again.
Whoa. Tom, are you going to school or to
a space fashion show? You like it? This
jacket is from the future style
collection limited edition. Yeah, it
looks like a solar panel. Can I charge
my phone on it?
Jealousy detected. These sneakers
customade. And this water bottle
titanium insulated and it glows in the
dark. Why would you need a water bottle
that glows in the dark? In case I get
thirsty during a blackout, obviously.
Okay, serious question. How much did all
this cost?
Let's just say it cost me an arm and a
leg. Tom, what have you done? How are
you walking with no legs? And carrying
stuff with no arms.
Relax. Cost an arm and a leg just means
it was super expensive. I still have all
my limbs. Barely. Good. Because if you
had actually paid with your arm, I'd be
calling the nurse. Honestly, I think my
wallet passed out from the shock. So,
how expensive are we talking? Well, the
jacket was $200, the sneakers were $150,
and the water bottle was $89.99.
What? For a water bottle? Does it sing
to you, too? No, but it keeps water cold
for 48 hours. That's like magic, Tom.
You could have bought a mini fridge for
that price. True, but does a fridge fit
in your backpack? Didn't think so. Okay,
let me guess. You're broke now, right?
Oh, absolutely.
I had to eat instant noodles for dinner
and breakfast and lunch and probably for
the next three months. Yeah, but at
least I look amazing. You look like a
fashionable flashlight. Thanks. That's
exactly what I was going for.
Next time, let me do your shopping. I
can find great stuff that doesn't cost
an arm, a leg, and your left eyebrow.
Deal. As long as it still glows.
Hey, I got his mango smoothies. Your
favorite.
It may be my last smoothie ever. What?
What are you talking about? I think I'm
going to kick the bucket. What? Tom, are
you okay? You can't die in a park.
That's so dramatic. Exactly. That's how
I'd want to go. Under a tree, birds
singing, smoothie in hand. No, no, no.
You're too young to kick any bucket.
What happened? Are you allergic to
mango? No, I just ate four chili hot
dogs in 5 minutes. Now my stomach is on
fire. I'm seeing the light. Tom, kick
the bucket means to die. You can't just
say that casually after eating too much
junk food. Well, I feel like I'm dying.
My stomach is staging a protest. You
nearly gave me a heart attack. I thought
you got bad news from the doctor or
something. Nope, just from the food
truck. Their mega volcano dog should be
illegal. Drink this and stop using
idioms like that without warning me
first. I can't help it. Idioms make life
more dramatic. Dying is boring. Kicking
the bucket. That's got flare. You know
what else has flare? My panic. I already
imagined your funeral.
What was it like? Were there fireworks?
No, but your parents were crying. Your
cat wore a black bow tie and someone
played sad violin music over your hot
dog photo.
Okay, that's beautiful. I'd want that.
Especially the cat. Tom, seriously, if
you keep eating like that, you will kick
the bucket someday. For real. I know. I
know. I just love spicy food. It gives
my life meaning and heartburn. Let's
make a deal. From now on, less mega
death dogs and more fruits and
vegetables. Uh, fine.
But if I eat too much broccoli, I might
kick the bucket from sadness. That's it.
I'm buying you a healthy cookbook titled
Eat This or Kick the Bucket. Only if
there is a chapter called Dessert That
Won't Kill You. Deal. Now drink your
smoothie and promise me no more chili
dog challenges. Promise. But if I ever
kick the bucket for real, please don't
let them serve salad at my funeral. You
got it. Only pizza, milkshakes, and a do
not blame the hot dogs sign.
Lily, guess what? Big news. You're
moving to another planet. No, even
better. I've just been hired as a
professional squirrel trainer. Cool. Can
they do your homework for you? I'm
serious. There's a whole squirrel circus
now. They jump through hoops, ride tiny
skateboards, and do math. I'm their
coach. Okay. Are you pulling my leg
again? Yes, but for a moment, you
believe me, didn't you? A little. I
mean, with you, anything seems possible.
That's what makes me dangerous. I mix
10% truth with 90% nonsense.
That's also how conspiracy theories
start, Tom. Fine, but for real this
time, I got a message on Instagram from
a guy who said I could be famous. He
wants me to star in a reality show
called Teen Life in a Treehouse. What?
I'm not. Well, maybe. Okay. Yes. But
come on, admit it. You're impressed by
my creativity.
Impressed? No. exhausted. Yes. You've
pulled my leg so many times, I think
it's stretched. Hey, stretched legs make
you taller. You're welcome. At this
rate, I'll be 7 ft tall by graduation.
Perfect. Then you can dunk basketballs
and reach the top shelf in the library.
Great. Can I also reach a quiet place
where no one pulls my leg every 5
minutes? Impossible. I'll find you. I'll
sneak up behind you and whisper, "Guess
what? I joined a rock band of penguins."
Let me guess. They play on ice and their
first song is Waddle This Way. I'm so
proud. You're learning to pull legs,
too. No, I'm learning to spot nonsense
from 10 miles away. Fair, but someday
I'll tell the truth, and you won't
believe me. That's already happened.
Remember when you actually won the art
contest and I thought it was a joke?
Right. You said nice try, Leonardo
datamo.
Exactly. You cried wolf too many times.
And now I'm the boy who pulled
everyone's leg and no one believed him.
Moral of the story, be careful how often
you mess around. People might stop
trusting your squirrel circus dreams.
Noted. But still, if a penguin band does
call me, I'm going.
Tom, you look like you were chased by
wild chickens. Close. A squirrel stole
my breakfast, my backpack ripped open,
and I stepped in gum twice. Is this your
version of a normal Tuesday? Nope. Today
is extra chaotic, but weirdly awesome.
You've got my attention. What happened
now? Okay, so this morning I was running
late because I couldn't find my other
sock. I spent 15 minutes looking for it,
then gave up and wore this pineapple one
instead. Point, said his sock. It's
bright.
Very pineapple. Right. So, I missed the
school bus. I was panicking. Thought I'd
get in trouble for being late. Makes
sense. So, I started running. Halfway
down the street, my backpack exploded.
Books flew everywhere. I nearly got hit
by a flying pencil case. Sounds about
right for you. Then, as I was picking
everything up, I bumped into Mr. Clark.
Literally, I dropped my lunch on his
shoes. You dumped food on our science
teacher? Yep. Cheese and crackers right
on his fancy brown shoes. I bet he was
thrilled. Actually, he laughed and then
said he was on his way to a science
event and had an extra ticket. Guess who
got invited? No way. Yes, me. Me. He
said, "Tom, since you already ruined my
shoes, you might as well come and ruin a
science show, too."
Classic, Mr. Clark. So now I get to go
to the National Science Expo, the one
with robot dogs, flying drones, and a
jelly bean powered blender. I've wanted
to go to that for 2 years. It's sold
out. I know. And all because I lost a
sock, missed the bus, and spilled cheese
on a teacher.
That's wild, but it's actually a perfect
example of Say it with me. A blessing in
disguise. You missed the bus. thought it
was a terrible day, but something good
came out of it in the end. Exactly. It's
like the universe said, "Hey, Tom's life
is a mess, but let's reward him with
flying robots." Or it said, "Let's give
Mr. Clark a science buddy and a new
reason to clean his shoes." Either way,
win-win. You know what? Next time
something bad happens to me, I'll try to
wait and see if it's a blessing in
disguise, too. Just don't pour food on
people. That part is optional. Noted.
Also, if you find a sock with tiny tacos
on it, that's mine.
You have that face again. What face? The
I definitely caused a disaster, but I'm
pretending it's fine face.
Okay, fine. I messed up big time. Like
mega time. Okay. What did you do this
time? You know how Sarah and Jenna were
already arguing this morning? Yeah.
About who was the better singer in the
school talent show? That got
dramatic.
Exactly. So, I thought, "Hey, I'll fix
this. I'll be the peacemaker." That
already sounds like a bad idea. So, I
walked up to them, smiled, and said,
"You're both amazing. Jenna's voice is
powerful, like a car alarm, and Sarah's
voice is sharp, like a fire drill." Tom,
why?
I thought I was being fair. I said
something nice about both of them. You
compared their singing to emergency
sounds, but powerful ones. Tom, you
didn't help. You added fuel to the fire.
Yes, I did. And then I threw gasoline on
it and then danced around it with
sparklers.
So, what happened next?
They both turned to me in complete
silence. Then Jenna screamed, "Are you
calling me loud?" And Sarah shouted, "At
least I don't sound like a dying fire
truck." Oh no.
Yep. They forgot their fight with each
other and teamed up to yell at me.
Impressive. You turned two angry solo
singers into a furious duet. Now neither
of them will talk to me. I've been
officially disinvited from the talent
show. You were in the talent show? I was
going to do interpretive dance with glow
sticks. I had a whole routine. Honestly,
that might be a blessing. Thanks. real
supportive. Tom, let me explain
something. When two people are already
arguing, the worst thing you can do is
say something weird or sarcastic. That's
what we call adding fuel to the fire. So
instead of calming things down, I
accidentally made them worse. Exactly.
It's like trying to put out a fire by
throwing oil on it. Or glitter. That
also makes things worse. Yes. Especially
in hair. Okay, lesson learned. Next time
I'll say nothing or just walk away.
Maybe hide under a table. Smart. Silence
is free and safe. You know what's not
safe? Trying to explain metaphors to
angry singers. Honestly, you deserve a
medal for being the first person ever
banned from a talent show for accidental
poetic insults. Thanks. I'll hang that.
imaginary medal next to my imaginary
trophy for best exit from a group chat.
Let's review today's lesson. When
tensions are high, don't be funny. Don't
be clever. Don't be Tom. Copy that.
Lily, guess what? I'm flying. Did you
drink three energy drinks again? No.
Well, maybe one, but that's not the
point. I just found out I got the lead
role in the school play. Wait, the lead?
You mean the one with all the dramatic
crying and sword fighting? Yes, me, the
star, the chosen one, the future
Broadway legend. Mr. Benson said, "Tom,
you've got the spark." Wow, that's
actually impressive. Congrats. You must
be I'm on cloud nine, higher than a
kite, floating like a happy burrito in
the sky. Okay, that's a very specific
image. I'm just so happy. Cloud9 happy.
Okay, language lesson time. On cloud9
means super mega ultra happy. It's like
happiness with wings. Nice. So, you're
not just happy, you're flying with
burritos. Exactly. I was so happy I
almost hugged Mr. Benson, but then I
remembered he has a no hug policy and
very sharp elbows. Good call. So, what's
the play? It's called The Kingdom of
Shadows.
Very mysterious. I play Prince Valor, a
royal hero with a tragic backstory, an
epic monologue, and a fake sword made of
foam.
Sounds intense. It is. I even have to
cry on stage during the emotional scene
where I say goodbye to my pet turtle.
Her name is Princess Pickle. You cry
over a turtle. A very noble turtle. She
represents hope. Wow. Theater is deep.
Lily, I cried while reading the script
twice. You cried at a cat food
commercial last week. That cat looked so
lonely. Okay, Prince Drama, let's talk
details. How many lines do you have? Um,
93.
93. Yep. Some of them are long, like
Shakespeare long. Still on cloud 9. I
might have slipped down to cloud 7 or
maybe cloud 6 and a half with a little
rain. You'll be fine. Just start
memorizing now. Do you even know the
first line? Proudly, I stand before you,
sword in hand, heart full of thunder.
Boom. Oscar worthy. Truly. Thanks. I've
been practicing that line all day in the
bathroom mirror. My mom thought I was
possessed. She's not wrong. Anyway, I'm
still excited. Nervous, yes, but also
proud. I never thought I'd get a lead
role. It's awesome, Tom. And you totally
deserve to be on Cloud9, even if you
forget your lines and fall off the stage
later. Thanks for the support. Want to
help running lines this week? Yes,
please. I'll pay you in snacks and
dramatic bowing. Perfect. I accept
cookies and ridiculous Shakespeare
impressions. My lady, thou shalt
receiveth both.
Sam, seriously, you're reading Super
Lizard versus RoboCow the day before our
math exam. Hey, this is very
educational. I'm learning about teamwork
and cows with lasers. Sigh. You need to
hit the books like right now. Boom. I
hit it. Happy? No, not like that. Hit
the books means study. Sit down and open
your math notes. Math notes? I think I
left those somewhere between home and
another dimension. Then you'd better
start over. We have less than 24 hours.
It's crunch time. I prefer snack time.
Can I hit the fridge instead? No. You
promised. You said you'd study with me
today. Yeah, but I also said I'd start
eating healthy. And you saw me inhale
three donuts this morning. Sam, focus.
Let's make a deal. We study for 1 hour,
then take a 10-minute break. Can the
break include snacks, video games, and a
nap? No, but it can include one cookie,
maybe two if you actually do math. All
right. All right. I'll hit the books
gently. I don't want to damage them. He
picks up a math book and opens it
slowly. Whoa. Is this English or ancient
alien code? It's algebra. Chapter 4.
Let's start with solving for X. Okay.
Step one, find X. Step two, run away and
cry. No. Step one, sit down and stop
being dramatic. Fine, but I expect a
cookie every time I get an answer right.
If that's what it takes, sure. But if
you don't study, you'll be crying over
your report card, not math. H, you make
a good point. I guess it's time to hit
the books with my brain this time. Now
we're talking.
Okay, Leo, spill it. Spill what? You're
acting weird. Shifty eyes, sweating like
a raccoon caught stealing cat food. You
know something? Me? No, just enjoying
the coffee. H delicious beans.
Love me some beans. Leo, I didn't say
anything. Exactly. Which means there is
something to say. Spill the beans. Okay.
Okay. But you can't get mad. Too late.
I'm already suspicious and curious. The
deadliest combo. All right. So, your
sister
may have accidentally sent me a group
message about your surprise birthday
party this Saturday.
What? I knew something was going on. I
saw mom buying streamers in the shape of
the number 30. And your brother asked me
if you like bounce houses. Oh no.
They're throwing me a toddler themed
party, aren't they? Technically,
the theme is forever young. There might
be a bouncy castle, glitter cupcakes,
and a clown.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear the
word clown. I didn't want to spill the
beans. You forced me. You bean spiller
forcer. Don't worry, Leo. I won't tell
them you told me. I'll just act
surprised. Really? Oh, yeah. Super
surprised. Like, oh my gosh, a bouncy
castle. I never expected this. And then
I'll trip and fall into the clown.
Please don't. I want to live to see
Sunday.
Okay. Who's ready for round four of Uno?
Followed by a documentary about penguins
that wear bow ties.
No one. Literally no one. Liam, it's
2:30 in the morning.
Exactly. Peak energy time. My brain is
finally awake. You want popcorn? I want
sleep. I want dreams. I want to hit the
sack so hard it files a complaint.
A Come on. It's a sleepover. Emphasis on
over. As in stay up all night forever.
Liam, my soul is leaving my body. My
eyelids are filing for divorce.
But Tara, the night is young.
No, the night is old, tired, and begging
for retirement. I'm hitting the sack
right now. Full force, no regrets. What
if I told you I still have cupcakes?
I will take one and eat it in bed. Right
before hitting the sack. Fine. Fine. But
tomorrow morning, we're watching that
penguin documentary.
Only if the penguins hit the sack, too.
Wait, hold up. Is that Are you doing
laundry? Why, yes. Yes, I am. And not
just laundry. I sorted it, too. Whites,
colors, the whole shebang. No way.
Should I call NASA? Alert the media?
Ryan touched the washing machine. Hey,
don't act so surprised. I do laundry,
you know, occasionally. Ryan, you've
lived here for six months. I've seen you
wear the same hoodie backwards and call
it a fresh look. This is a once in a
blue moon event. That's not true. I do
laundry when I absolutely have to, which
is literally when you run out of
underwear and start considering
swimsuits. That was one time and I was
going to the grocery store. No one even
noticed. Oh, they noticed. Someone
posted a photo in the neighborhood
Facebook group. Caption: Man buying
bananas in Spongebob swim trunks. Okay.
Yeah, that was a low point. A low point
followed by a high point. You doing
laundry. Thanks. It feels good. Clean.
Adultish. I even used fabric softener.
It smells like lavender success. Well,
don't go too far. We wouldn't want you
doing laundry more than once in a blue
moon. The shock might kill us all.
Relax. I have a system. Every time
there's a lunar eclipse, I'll do a load,
maybe two. Perfect. So, see you at the
next one in 2041.
Josh, today is the day. No more running.
Running? Who's running? I'm simply
strategically avoiding. You have a
dentist appointment at 300 p.m. You're
going I'd rather wrestle a raccoon in a
dark alley than sit in that chair. Josh,
you literally screamed last week because
your smoothie was too cold. My tooth
betrayed me. It went rogue. That's
because you haven't been to the dentist
in over a year. It's time to bite the
bullet. Bite the bullet. Is that a thing
they make you do now? Because I don't
think dental bullets are FDA approved.
No, it's an idiom. Bite the bullet means
to face something difficult or
unpleasant even though you don't want
to. Ah, so basically do the thing, cry
later. Exactly. It comes from old
wartime days. Soldiers would bite a
bullet to deal with the pain when there
was no anesthesia. Charming. So now I'm
a soldier in the war against plaque.
Yes. And your weapon is courage and
maybe mint floss. Fine, I'll bite the
bullet, but I want it on record that I
go down as a hero. A hero who cries
during cleanings. Got it. Also, I'm
bringing my lucky hoodie, noiseancelling
headphones, and a playlist called Tooth
Hery Blues. And maybe try brushing your
teeth before you go. Just once. Rude. I
brush. I just don't always remember
toothpaste, Josh. That's just rubbing
sadness on your teeth. All right. All
right. I'll do it. I'll face the
dentist. I'll sit in the chair. I'll
open my mouth. I'll probably cry, but
I'll do it. That's the spirit. And when
I survive, we're getting pizza. Depends.
Do you want soft crust or just soup? I
hate you. I know, but your teeth will
love me.
[Music]
[Music]
Hey there, welcome back. Let me ask you,
how do you usually start your day? Do
you jump right out of bed or hit the
snooze button a couple of times? Do you
check your phone first or take a deep
breath and stretch?
Our morning routines say a lot about us.
And in today's episode, we're going to
walk through a complete morning routine
in English step by step so you can talk
about your daily life just like a native
speaker. This will be super useful if
you're working on describing your day,
building your vocabulary, or practicing
shadowing. So, grab your headphones, get
comfortable, and let's dive in.
[Music]
All right, here we go. I usually wake up
at 6:30 in the morning. When the alarm
goes off, I quickly turn it off. Though
sometimes I lie in bed for a few more
minutes before actually getting up. Once
I'm up, I stretch a little to wake my
body. I open the windows to let in some
fresh air. It really helps me feel more
awake.
Then I head to the bathroom. I brush my
teeth, wash my face with cold water, and
take a shower. Sometimes it's just a
quick rinse, and other times I enjoy a
longer, more relaxing shower. After
that, I dry off with a towel, apply some
lotion or moisturizer, comb my hair, and
get dressed for the day.
Next, it's time for a glass of water. I
always drink a full glass of water in
the morning. It really wakes me up and
gets me going. Then I prepare breakfast.
Sometimes I go for toast and eggs, and
other days I make oatmeal or a smoothie.
I love having a hot cup of tea or coffee
with my breakfast. While I eat, I
usually listen to music or a podcast,
something light to start the day.
After breakfast, I clean up the kitchen,
wash the dishes, and wipe down the
counters. Then I check my phone for any
messages or notifications.
I like to make a to-do list for the day.
It helps me stay focused and organized.
If I have a bit of extra time, I squeeze
in some light exercise. Sometimes I go
for a short walk or do a bit of yoga.
Even just 10 minutes of stretching makes
a big difference. Finally, I sit down at
my desk and start work. I check my
emails, review my schedule, and begin
with the most important task of the day.
All right, now it's time to practice
speaking together. Here's how it works.
I'll say a sentence nice and slow, and
you repeat after me. Ready? Let's begin.
I wake up at 6:30. Now you try. I wake

emails and review my schedule.
I begin with the most important task.
Repeat after me. I begin with the most
important task.
Well done. You're doing amazing.
Speaking out loud like this helps your
pronunciation, rhythm, and confidence.
And now I want you to think, what's your
morning routine like? Is it similar to
mine or completely different? Take a
moment and try saying a few things about
your own routine in English. Even one or
two sentences is a great start. And
remember, the more you practice, the
more natural it feels. Just like
brushing your teeth, make English
practice a daily habit.
All right, now let's go over some useful
questions people often ask about morning
routines. These are great for speaking
practice. Try answering them out loud in
English, even if you're alone. Speaking
your answers is a powerful way to build
fluency. Here we go. What time do you
wake up? Do you eat breakfast every day?
What do you usually eat in the morning?
Do you exercise in the morning? What's
the first thing you do after waking up?
How do you feel when you wake up early?
Do you prefer tea or coffee in the
morning?
How long does your morning routine
usually take? Take a moment to think
about your answers and say them out
loud. The more you speak, the more
confident you'll become.
Now, let's take it a step further and
learn how native speakers express these
ideas more naturally. We'll go through
each one slowly so you can repeat and
practice.
Instead of saying I get out of bed, you
can say I roll out of bed, repeat after
me. I roll out of bed at 700 a.m.
Instead of I wash my face, you might
hear I splash some cold water on my face
to wake up. Repeat, I splash some cold
water on my face to wake up. Rather than
saying I make breakfast, try these
natural phrases. I whip up some eggs. I
grab a quick bite. Repeat. I whip up a
quick breakfast before heading out.
Repeat. I grab a quick bite and leave
for work.
And instead of just I exercise, say I go
for a quick jog. I do a short workout.
Repeat. I go for a quick jog in the
morning. Repeat. I like to do a short
home workout.
These small changes make your English
sound more natural and conversational.
Keep practicing. You're doing great.
Let's practice using adverbs and
connectors to make your sentences flow
more smoothly and sound more fluent. For
example, instead of saying, "I wake up,
I brush my teeth, I eat breakfast," you
can say something like, "I usually wake
up around 7. Then I brush my teeth and
freshen up. After that, I make some
breakfast and enjoy a quiet moment
before starting my day." Let's say that
together, nice and slow.
I usually wake up around 7. Then I brush
my teeth and freshen up. After that, I
make some breakfast and enjoy a quiet
moment before starting my day. Great
job. You can also say, "On weekdays, my
morning routine is quick and simple, but
on weekends, I like to take it slow and
relax a bit more."
Now think about your own routine. Is
your morning fast and busy or slow and
relaxed. How would you describe it in
English?
Let's imagine you're having a
conversation with a new friend or a
teacher and they ask you, "What's your
morning routine like?" Here's a simple
and natural way to answer. Well, I
usually get up at 6:30. The first thing
I do is drink a glass of water. Then I
brush my teeth and take a quick shower.
After that, I make some breakfast,
usually toast and eggs and a hot cup of
tea. Then I clean up and get ready for
work. It's not too long, not too short,
just natural and clear. Practice saying
your own version out loud. That's how
you build confidence and fluency. one
sentence at a time. Now, here's
something fun. I'm going to give you a
short paragraph. I'll read it with you,
and I want you to repeat after me.
Ready? Let's go. I wake up early in the
morning. I stretch, open the window, and
breathe in the fresh air. Then, I head
to the bathroom, brush my teeth, and
take a shower. I get dressed and make
breakfast. I love drinking a hot cup of
tea while listening to soft music. It
helps me feel calm and ready for the
day. Nice work. Now, let's kick things
up a bit. Time for a challenge round.
I'll ask you some questions and you
answer out loud in English. Don't worry
about making it perfect. Just speak.
Ready?
What's the first thing you do after
waking up? Do you check your phone in
the morning?
What do you like to eat for breakfast?
Do you prefer a cold shower or a hot
shower?
Do you listen to music or watch
something while getting ready?
What time do you usually start work or
school?
Keep going. Even if you're not sure, say
something simple. That's how fluency
grows, by practicing out loud, not just
reading. Here's another great idea. Try
writing about your morning routine in
English. Use it as a journaling
practice. You can start like this. My
morning routine. I usually wake up at
then I
after that I
finally I
just fill in the blanks with your own
words. It's simple and it really helps
you start thinking in English. We've
covered a lot today from basic phrases
to natural expressions, speaking
practice, question rounds, and even
journaling tips. And now you're ready to
talk about your morning routine in
clear, fluent English. But before we
wrap up, let's do one final review. Here
are 50 simple morning routine sentences.
Short, easy to remember, and super
useful. Repeat them out loud if you can.
I wake up at 6:00 a.m. I get out of bed
slowly. I stretch my body. I turn off
the alarm. I check my phone. I go to the
bathroom. I brush my teeth. I wash my
face. I take a shower. I use shampoo and
soap. I dry off with a towel. I get
dressed.
I comb my hair. I drink a glass of
water. I make my bed. I open the
windows. I enjoy the morning breeze.
I pray or meditate. I do some light
stretching. I read the news or check
emails.
I prepare breakfast. I boil water for
tea or coffee. I make toast and eggs. I
sit at the table to eat. I enjoy my
breakfast slowly. I clean the dishes. I
pack my lunch. I check my schedule. I
write down my to-do list. I listen to
some music. I watch a short video. I
review my tasks. I organize my bag. I
check if I forgot anything. I wear my
shoes. I take a deep breath before
leaving. I look in the mirror. I smile
at myself. I grab my keys. I say goodbye
to my family. I step out of the house.
I walk to the bus stop. I wait for the
bus. I listen to a podcast on the way. I
enjoy the fresh air. I reach my
workplace or school. I greet my friends
or co-workers.
I start my work with a smile. I feel
ready and focused. I say to myself,
"It's going to be a good day."
These simple lines are great for
building confidence when talking about
your daily routine, especially in the
morning. You can repeat them, write
them, or even record yourself saying
them. Keep practicing and you'll sound
more fluent every single day. All right,
before we wrap up, let's do one last
little challenge. Can you talk about
your own morning routine in English?
Take a few minutes right now and say it
out loud just like we practiced. You can
follow this simple pattern. I usually
wake up at time then I action. After
that I action. Speak it, feel it, make
it real. Every time you describe your
routine, your English gets a little
stronger and more natural. And remember,
it doesn't have to be perfect. Fluency
comes with practice, not perfection.
Thanks for joining me today. I hope this
episode helped you feel more confident
and excited to speak English in your
daily life. If you enjoyed it, don't
forget to follow the podcast or YouTube
channel, leave a review, and most
importantly, come back tomorrow for more
practice. Next time we'll cover your
evening routine or even a full day in
English so you can express your daily
life clearly, naturally, and fluently.
Until then, keep learning, keep
speaking, and keep growing. Take care
and have a great day.
Hey, hey, English learners. Welcome back
to English Phrases Hub, the podcast
where we help you speak real everyday
English with confidence. I'm Emma. And
I'm Jake. And today, ao boy, we've got a
super relatable situation for you. Ever
been stuck in an elevator with someone
you kind of know and you have no idea
what to say? Uh, yes. Like, do you make
small talk? Do you comment on the
weather for the 10th time? Or do you
just pretend to check your phone and
hope the elevator moves faster? We've
all been there. So, in this episode,
you'll hear a short funny dialogue
between two people who run into each
other in an elevator, and it gets well,
just a little awkward. But that's the
point. We'll show you how to handle
those weird little moments, how to make
small talk, avoid sounding rude, and
keep the conversation going even when
it's a little uncomfortable. So, if
you've ever wanted to sound natural in
those everyday, uh-oh, what do I say
now? situations, this one's for you. All
right, let's jump into today's dialogue.
Don't worry if you don't catch
everything the first time. We'll go
through it step by step right after.
Let's go.
Oh, hey Rachel. Oh, hi Mark, right?
Yeah, from accounting. We met at that um
really awkward birthday thing for Steve.
Oh, yeah. With the melted cake and the
fire alarm. Good times, right? Still
can't believe someone lit candles right
under the sprinkler.
Poor Steve. Worst birthday ever.
So, how's your Monday so far?
Not too bad. I only hit snooze twice
today, so that's progress.
Impressive. I hit it four times. I
basically negotiated with my alarm clock
this morning. Ha, I totally get that. I
almost poured orange juice into my
cereal. Thought it was milk. Nice.
Classic Monday move.
So, any big plans this week? Not really.
Just meetings, meetings, and more
meetings. You same here. I have one at
10 that I'm absolutely not ready for. I
might just nod and hope no one asks me
anything. Huh? The classic zoom stare.
I've mastered that.
Yep. Just lean forward and look
thoughtful. Works every time. You ever
feel like the elevator's judging us all
the time? Especially when it makes that
loud ding like you again.
[Laughter]
Well, this is actually kind of nice. I
never talk to people in here. Same. I
usually just stare at the numbers like
it's a game show. Will I make it to
floor 7 without someone sneezing? Let's
find out. Well, this is me, floor 5.
Hope your day is better than Steve's
birthday.
Thanks, and good luck with your 10:00.
You've got this. Just nod confidently.
I'll channel my inner CEO. See you
around. See you.
Okay, that was a pretty realistic
elevator scene, right? I've definitely
had moments like that where I'm just
trying to survive the small talk. Oh,
for sure. I think everyone has. But
here's the good news. Those little
conversations are great opportunities to
practice real English. So, let's go
through some of the most useful phrases
from that dialogue. First up, how's it
going? This is a super common casual way
to ask how are you? You can use it with
co-workers, friends, even strangers you
see often. Exactly. It's less formal
than how do you do and more natural than
how are you today. So next time you see
someone in the hallway or elevator, just
say hey, how's it going? Next we have
tell me about it. This one is really
fun. You say it when someone tells you
something you totally agree with,
especially if it's frustrating or
annoying, right? Like when Rachel said,
"Just trying to survive Monday." And
Mark replied, "Tell me about it." He
meant, "Yeah, me, too. Mondays are
tough." Now, here's a helpful one.
That's a rough start. You use this when
someone tells you something that didn't
go well, like spilling coffee or
sleeping through their alarm. It's a
friendly way to show you care without
being too dramatic. You're basically
saying, "Oof, that sounds like a tough
morning." Speaking of mornings, let's
talk about snooze. If you say, "I hit
snooze four times," it means you kept
pressing that button on your alarm to
delay it. You didn't want to get up.
Exactly. Everyone's done it. I
negotiated with my alarm clock this
morning. That made me laugh. Now, here's
a super encouraging phrase. You've got
this. It means good luck or I believe in
you. Rachel said it to support Mark
before his meeting. It's really positive
and friendly. You can say it to a friend
before a test, a presentation, or even
just a long Monday. Just look them in
the eye and say, "You've got this." And
finally, fingers crossed. This means
you're hoping for the best. It's like
saying, "I hope everything goes well."
Yeah. And people actually cross their
fingers while saying it. You might hear
someone say, "Fingers crossed I don't
embarrass myself in the meeting." or
fingers crossed the elevator doesn't
stop on every floor. So now you've got
seven great phrases to use in small
talk, whether it's in the elevator, the
office, or anywhere else. And they're
all super practical, natural, real life
English that helps you sound like a
native speaker, even in awkward
situations. Don't worry about being
perfect. Just try one or two of these
phrases the next time you talk to
someone. Small talk gets easier the more
you practice. That's right. And now that
you've heard all these useful phrases,
it's time to see them in action again in
a brand new situation. Yep, dialogue 2
is coming up. It's another short
conversation using some of the same
phrases, but this time things get even
funnier. Let's just say there's an
unexpected sneeze, a broken coffee
machine, and some next level
awkwardness. So, sit back, relax, and
listen closely. See how many phrases you
recognize from earlier. Here comes
dialogue two.
Come on. Come on. Just work for once.
Uh-oh. Is the coffee machine giving you
a hard time? It hates me. Every time I
try to use it, it either jams or
explodes.
That's a rough start to the morning.
Tell me about it. I haven't even checked
my emails yet, and I already want to go
home. At least you're up. I hit snooze
like five times today. I almost wore
mismatched shoes. Honestly, that would
have been a bold fashion statement.
Thanks. Maybe I'll start a trend. Oh,
no. That didn't sound good. I'd back
away slowly if I were you. Too late.
Okay, that's enough caffeine drama for
today. Fingers crossed it didn't destroy
your shirt again. No stains yet. I've
got a meeting in 10. So, naturally, this
is the perfect time for a coffee
explosion. You've got this. Just walk in
confident. Pretend everything is fine.
Like a true professional, covered in
coffee, but smiling. Exactly. You know,
for someone who causes chaos wherever he
goes, you're surprisingly optimistic.
What can I say? It's a gift. Want me to
bring you a coffee from downstairs?
Tempting, but I don't trust you with
coffee anymore. Fair. I wouldn't either.
Sorry, allergies. The air conditioning
here hates me. Bless you. Maybe the
coffee machine and the AC are secretly
working together. Corporate sabotage.
Classic Tuesday. All right, I'm going to
go pretend I read my meeting notes.
Catch you later. Definitely. Good luck
and keep your coffee far away from the
projector. Noted.
Okay, that break room conversation was
just pure chaos. Broken coffee machine,
sneezing, suspicious air conditioning,
classic Tuesday energy, right? But even
in the middle of all that awkwardness,
there were so many great real life
phrases packed in there. Let's break
them down so you can use them too
without needing to break a coffee
machine. Let's kick things off with one
you heard early in the conversation.
That's a rough start. We say this when
someone's day begins badly. Maybe they
spill coffee, miss the bus, or forget
their lunch. Exactly. It's a nice way to
show sympathy without being dramatic.
You're saying, "Wow, unlucky start. I
feel you." Try it. Oh no, you dropped
your phone in the toilet. That's a rough
start. We explained this one before, but
it's worth repeating because it's so
common. Totally. When someone says
something you relate to, like being
tired or stressed, you can just say,
"Tell me about it." It's short, casual,
and instantly connects you with the
other person. You're saying, "Yes, I
feel the same way. Try it. I have five
meetings today. Tell me about it. We've
all done it. Hitting snooze means
pressing that little button on your
alarm clock or phone to delay it. If you
hit snooze five times, it probably means
you really didn't want to wake up or you
had a long night. It's a fun way to
explain why you're feeling sleepy or
late in the morning. Example, sorry I'm
late. I hit snooze too many times. Here
it is again. Fingers crossed. It means
you're hoping for a good result. In this
case, Rachel said it when she hoped
Mark's shirt wouldn't get ruined again
by coffee. You can say this before a
test, a big presentation, or even when
your lunch is in the office fridge, and
you hope no one stole it. Example,
fingers crossed my package arrives
today. We love this one. It's so
encouraging. You're basically telling
someone, "You can do it." Rachel says it
to boost Mark's confidence before his
meeting, even though he just had a
coffee explosion. It's perfect for
calming nerves and supporting friends or
co-workers. Try it. I'm nervous about
the interview. You've got this classic
one. When someone sneezes in English,
it's polite to say, "Bless you." It
doesn't matter if you know the person or
not. It's just a small gesture of
kindness. Even if you're halfway through
sipping your coffee and someone sneezes
across the room, you say, "Bless you."
Mark sneezes. Bless you. Easy. And
finally, a great way to say goodbye
informally. Catch you later. You'll hear
this everywhere. It just means see you
soon or bye for now. It's friendly,
casual, and super useful, especially
with co-workers or friends. Example, all
right, I got to go to my meeting. Catch
you later. And that's it. These phrases
might sound simple, but they make a huge
difference when you're trying to sound
more natural in English. They're the
little things that help you connect with
people even during awkward coffee soaked
conversations. All right, now it's your
turn. We're going to practice saying
some of the key phrases from today's
episode. Don't worry, just relax,
listen, and repeat after us. And hey, if
you're listening on the bus, in bed, or
while making coffee, don't be shy. Say
it out loud or whisper. Whispering still
counts. Let's go. First phrase. That's a
rough start. That's a rough start. Your
turn
again. A little faster this time. That's
a rough start.
Next up, tell me about it. Tell me about
it. Say it with us.
And now on your own. Ready? Tell me
about it.
Here's one we all know too well. I hit
snooze like five times. I hit snooze
like five times. Try it.
Once more, but more casual. I hit snooze
like five times.
Now, let's try a positive phrase. You've
got this. You've got this. Your turn.
Say it with confidence. Yes. Again.
You've got this.
Let's practice this polite one. Bless
you. Imagine someone sneezes. What do
you say? Bless you.
Nice job. Even just learning that one
can make you sound friendly and
thoughtful. Last one, the goodbye
phrase. Catch you later. Catch you
later. Say it like you're talking to a
co-orker or a friend. Catch you later.
All right, that was awesome. Don't worry
if you didn't get it perfect. Just
practicing out loud already makes you
stronger and more confident. Exactly.
The more you repeat, the more natural it
becomes. You've got this. All right,
it's time for listener Q&A where we
answer your questions about learning
English and share a few quick tips along
the way. First question comes from Pedro
in Brazil. He asks, "Why do native
speakers speak so fast and how can I
catch what they're saying?" Great
question. Native speakers do speak
quickly, but they also connect words in
ways that can be confusing. That's why
listening practice like podcasts and
dialogues really helps. Try to focus on
the rhythm, not just the individual
words. And don't be afraid to pause and
repeat what you hear. You'll get better
at understanding full phrases, not just
vocabulary. Next question. This one's
from Natsuki in Japan. She writes, "I
understand the words, but I freeze in
real conversations. How do I stop
overthinking and actually speak?" We've
all been there. Honestly, it's about
building confidence little by little.
Start with short phrases just like the
ones we practice today. And don't worry
about being perfect. Exactly. Even
saying something simple like that's a
rough start or bless you in a real
situation is a win. You're using real
English in real life and that's how
fluency grows. And our last one from
Olly in Jordan. He asks, "Is it okay to
use small talk phrases like how's it
going or catch you later with my boss or
should I be more formal?" Good question,
Ali. It depends on your workplace
culture. In many Western offices,
especially in the US or UK, small talk
is totally fine, even with your manager,
as long as it's polite and respectful.
Yeah, how's it going is casual but not
rude. And catch you later is friendly.
But if your boss is very formal or the
office culture is more traditional, you
might want to stick with good morning or
see you soon. Thanks to everyone who
sent in a question. If you've got one,
just leave it in the comments. We love
hearing from you. Coming up next, a
little challenge to help you speak
English even more naturally. Let's do
it. All right, it's challenge time. This
is where we give you a fun, simple way
to practice speaking English using the
phrases from today's episode. So, here's
your mission. Imagine it's Monday
morning. You walk into the office, the
coffee machine is broken, someone
sneezes, you're running late, and you're
exhausted. We've all had that kind of
day. So, your challenge is to create a
short conversation, just two or three
lines, using at least three of these
phrases. That's a rough start. Tell me
about it. I hit snooze like five times.
Fingers crossed. You've got this. Or
bless you. You can write your mini
conversation in the comments or say it
out loud wherever you are right now.
Bonus points if you use humor like Mark
and Rachel. And if you want, post it on
Instagram or Tik Tok and tag us. We'd
love to see your creativity. Just
remember, every time you speak, even a
little, you're improving. So don't wait
for the perfect sentence. Start with
what you know. You've got this. Okay.
Before we say goodbye, let's do a quick
recap of what we covered today. We
started with a funny but totally
realistic dialogue in an elevator.
Awkward small talks, build coffee, and
all. Then we jumped into dialogue two,
where things got even messier in the
breakroom. Yep. sneezing, broken coffee
machines, and two people trying their
best to survive Monday. But more
importantly, we learned some great real
life English phrases along the way.
Let's review a few of them. That's a
rough start to show sympathy when
someone has a bad morning. Tell me about
it. When you totally agree with someone,
I hit snooze like five times to explain
you didn't want to wake up. Fingers
crossed when you're hoping for good
luck. You've got this a great phrase to
encourage someone. And of course, bless
you. The polite thing to say when
someone sneezes. And don't forget, small
talk might feel awkward, but it's one of
the best ways to sound natural and
connect with people in English. Exactly.
So whether you're in an elevator, at the
coffee machine, or just walking past a
co-orker, try one of these phrases. Even
a short you've got this can brighten
someone's day. Thanks for joining us
today. And if you completed the speaking
challenge, we're proud of you. Keep it
up. We'll catch you in the next episode
of English Phrases Hub. Until then,
practice daily, speak boldly, and don't
be afraid to sound human.
See you next time.
Hello English learners and welcome back
to English phrases hub. My name is Jake
and I'm Emma. How are you doing today
Emma? Honestly Jake, I'm feeling like a
total student again today.
Same here. And that's because we've got
a really fun episode all about school.
Yep. We're talking about real English
you'll hear and use in the classroom.
Whether you're a student, a teacher, or
just curious about how people talk in
school settings, this is everyday
English, natural, practical, and super
useful. We'll go over vocabulary like
homework, assignment, pop quiz, and even
what to say when you want to go to the
bathroom during class.
Classic. And we've also got real
dialogues, grammar tips, speaking
practice, you name it. So, if you've
ever been in a classroom and thought,
"Uh, what do I say right now?" This
episode's for you. All right, let's dive
in. First up, some key classroom
vocabulary you'll want to know. All
right, everyone, grab your backpack and
sharpen your pencils. Just kidding. But
seriously, it's time for our vocabulary
preview. Yep. Today's list is packed
with school vibes. 15 essential words
and phrases you'll hear in every
classroom. If you've ever been a student
or just watched a school movie, these
are for you. We'll explain each one,
give examples, and hey, if you want to
practice pronunciation, repeat after us.
It's a great way to train your speaking.
Let's do this. First up, assignment.
That's any task your teacher gives you,
usually to finish in class or at home.
Like, our English assignment is due
tomorrow. Uh, that brings back high
school memories. I swear I used to do my
assignments 5 minutes before class.
Laughs. Same. My first assignment ever
was drawing my family tree, and I
totally glued everyone in the wrong
order.
Hey, it's the effort that counts. Next
project. Now, a project is a bigger deal
than a regular assignment. It usually
takes a few days or even weeks. And
sometimes it's a group project, which
can either be amazing or a total
nightmare. We've all had that one group
member who disappears until the last
minute. True story. Example, we're
working on a science project about
volcanoes. Ooh, I love this next word,
recess. If you're a kid, this is
probably your favorite part of the day.
Definitely. Recess is break time when
students head outside, play games, or
just relax between lessons. Like during
recess, the kids played soccer on the
field. I miss recess. Adults should get
that, too. Right. Okay. Principal is
next. Careful with this one. It's not
principal like a belief. Principal with
an a is the person in charge of the
school. Exactly. You might hear, "The
principal visited our classroom today."
Next up, classmate. That's anyone who's
in your class. Not necessarily your best
friend, just someone you study with.
Example, I'm working on a project with
my classmate Sarah. All right. Word
number six, textbook. That's your main
study book for a subject. usually full
of lessons, exercises, and sometimes the
answers if you're lucky.
Laughs. Example, please open your math
textbook to page 12. Moving on.
Schedule. This one shows your class
times and subjects. Like, according to
my schedule, I have history after lunch.
And sometimes four math classes in a
row. Oh, okay. Deep breath. Due date.
This is the final day. Something has to
be finished. Like, the due date for the
essay is next Monday. And no, you can't
push it back by just asking nicely.
Laughs. Next is a classic. Homework.
Love it or hate it, it's a part of
school life. Yep. It's the work you do
after class. Example, we had a lot of
math homework last night. Here's a more
advanced one, syllabus. That's basically
your course guide, right? It shows what
topics you'll cover, what assignments
are coming, and how the grading works.
Example, the teacher gave us the
syllabus on the first day. Now, brace
yourselves. Pop quiz. Two words every
student fears.
That's a surprise test. No warning, just
surprise. Like, we had a pop quiz in
history today. Thanks a lot, Mr. Adams.
Okay, number 12. Late or absent. If you
arrive late, well, you're late. If you
don't show up at all, you're absent. For
example, I was absent yesterday. Did we
have any homework? Next up, pay
attention. Something teachers say on
repeat. Yep. It just means listen
carefully, stop talking. Example, please
pay attention. This will be on the test.
Almost there. Word 14, turn in your
homework. That means hand it in. Give it
to the teacher. Like, don't forget to
turn in your homework before class ends.
And last but not least, raise your hand.
That's what you do if you want to ask a
question or answer one politely.
Example, if you know the answer, raise
your hand. And that's it. 15 must know
classroom phrases to boost your English.
If you learned just a few of these
today, you're already speaking more
naturally. And hey, don't worry if you
missed a couple, you can rewind, review,
and repeat anytime. Maybe even write
them down or make some flashcards. And
the best part is you'll hear a bunch of
these again in the dialogues coming up.
All right, it's time to jump into our
first dialogue of the day. We'll play it
for you once at a natural speed. Yeah.
And don't worry if you don't catch
everything the first time. Stick with
us. We'll break it all down together.
Exactly. Just listen, relax, and let's
get into it.
Good morning, John. How are you today?
Good morning, Mr. Mads. I'm doing well,
thank you. And you? I'm great. Thanks
for asking. Did you bring your homework
assignment? Yes, here it is. I worked on
it last night. I hope I did it
correctly. Thank you. Let's see. H. Your
handwriting looks neat today, but just a
small reminder. Next time, don't forget
to write the date at the top. Oh, right.
Sorry. I'll remember next time. No
worries at all. That's what learning is
for. Now, can you please take out your
textbook and turn to page 10? Sure.
Okay. Page 10. Great. This is the start
of unit 3. We're going to read a short
story and answer some questions. Are you
ready? Um,
actually, Mr. Mads, could I go to the
bathroom, please? Yes, of course. Just
don't take too long. All right. Thank
you. I'll be quick. Excuse me. I'm back.
Welcome back, John. Now, where were we?
We were about to read the story on page
10, I think. That's right. But before we
begin, just a quick check. Do you
remember when your science project is
due? Uh, I think the due date is next
Friday. Correct. So, don't leave it to
the last minute. No promises, but I'll
try.
All right, let's get started then.
Please read the first paragraph out loud
when you're ready.
All right, that was such a realistic
classroom scene. I loved how natural
their conversation was. This is exactly
how you'd speak in a real school
setting. Yeah, and shout out to John.
What a polite guy.
I mean, he handled that classroom like a
pro. Let's go through the conversation
and highlight some of the golden phrases
and moments. First, the teacher started
with good morning, John. How are you
today? Classic teacher move. Warm
greeting, personal touch. It's not just
let's get started. It's how are you
today? It sets the tone. And John's
reply was spoton. I'm doing well, thank
you. And you? So natural, so polite.
This is a great phrase to memorize if
you want to start your day in English
the right way. Then the teacher asks,
"Did you bring your homework
assignment?" That's such a useful
question. Did you bring is in the past
tense and he uses homework assignment?
Which sounds formal but common in
school. And John said, "Yes, I worked on
it last night." I love how he added, "I
hope I did it correctly." That's such a
humble and thoughtful thing to say. It
shows effort even if you're not 100%
sure. And then he gives him a soft
correction. Just a small reminder. Next
time, don't forget to write the date. So
polite, so gentle. Teachers often say
things like that to keep feedback
positive. Right? He didn't say you
forgot the date. He said just a small
reminder. That's how you correct someone
without embarrassing them. Next, he
tells him, "Take out your textbook and
turn to page 10." Super useful. This is
one of those classroom phrases that
never gets old. Totally. Take out your
textbook and turn to page. If you're in
a class, you'll hear these every day.
Then comes my favorite moment. John
raises his hand and says, "Excuse me,
could I go to the bathroom, please?"
Textbook perfect. He used excuse me to
get attention. Could I to ask permission
politely and please at the end? All
three together, chef's kiss. And Mr.
Mads replies like a pro. Yes, of course.
Just don't take too long. He's setting a
boundary, but he's still being kind. And
then John comes back with, "Excuse me,
I'm back." That's such a small thing,
but really polite. It shows respect for
the classroom and the teacher. I liked
when he asked, "Do you remember when
your science project is due?" That's
real. Teachers are always reminding
students about due dates. And John
answers with, "I think the due date is
next Friday." That I think is a really
nice softener. If you're not 100% sure,
it's a polite way to guess. And then
finally, he says, "Please read the first
paragraph out loud when you're ready."
So gentle. when you're ready makes it
sound supportive, not pushy. Honestly,
this whole exchange was full of useful
phrases. Could I please turn to page? I
hope I did it correctly. Excuse me. I'm
back. It's a classroom master class. And
John nailed the polite tone from start
to finish. He sounded respectful,
confident, and calm. That's the kind of
English we want our listeners to feel
comfortable using. Exactly. You don't
need to sound perfect. You just need to
sound thoughtful and kind. And that's
what John did. Okay. So, we've listened.
We've broken it down. And now you know
what's going on in that classroom scene.
And guess what? You're already picking
up the vocabulary. But there's one more
thing we need to look at. Yep. Time to
shine a light on the grammar hiding
inside that conversation.
Don't worry, we're not going full
grammar class on you. No way. This is
real life grammar, the kind that helps
you sound polite, natural, and confident
when you speak. So, if you've ever
wondered how to ask questions the right
way in class, like when you need to go
somewhere or need help, this next part
is for you. Let's jump into it. Grammar
doesn't have to be scary. It can
actually be kind of fun. Okay, now let's
dive into today's grammar point. And
don't worry, we'll keep it fun. Yeah, no
boring grammar lectures here. We
promise. Today's topic is actually super
useful, especially in school. We're
talking about how to ask questions
politely using can and could. Right.
This is one of those things that can
make you sound a lot more natural and
more respectful when talking to teachers
or classmates. Exactly. Because
shouting, "Give me a pencil." isn't the
best way to make friends. Definitely
not. Let's start with the basics. We use
can to ask for permission or request
something in an informal way. For
example, can I go to the bathroom? Can
you help me with this problem? Simple,
right? But then we have could, which is
kind of like the older, more polite
sibling of can. We use could when we
want to sound softer or more formal. So
instead of can I borrow your book, you
could say, could I borrow your book,
please? It sounds just a little more
polite. Yeah. And you'll hear this
difference all the time, especially in
school. If you're speaking to a teacher
or someone you don't know well, could is
often the better choice. Here's a little
comparison to make it super clear.
Informal, can I sit here? Polite, could
I sit here, please? Informal, can you
explain this? Polite, could you explain
this, please?
Informal. Can I ask a question? Polite.
Could I ask a question? Pro tip. If you
add please at the end, it's even more
polite. That's true. Please is the magic
word. Now, here's something important.
Can and could both work in most
classroom situations, but there's a
slight difference in tone. Exactly. Can
I ask a question is friendly and casual.
totally fine with your classmates or
even your teacher if you already have a
good relationship. But if it's your
first day or you're speaking to someone
in authority or you just want to be
extra respectful, go with, "Could I ask
a question, please?" Let's do a quick
little roleplay. Jake, you're the
student. I'm the teacher. Go. Uh, Emma,
can I borrow a pencil?
And how do we ask politely?
Oops. I mean, excuse me. Could I borrow
a pencil, please? Much better. Gold star
for you. Yes. See, it really does make a
difference. So, remember this little
formula when you need to ask something
in class. Could I plus action plus
please? Like, could I sit near the
window, please? Could you explain number
five again, please? You can also start
with, "Excuse me," to sound extra
polite, like, "Excuse me, could I leave
class a bit early today?" Teachers will
appreciate that. And hey, it's great
practice for everyday life, too. You'll
use these phrases in shops, at work,
even when asking for directions.
Exactly. Politeness is powerful. So,
next time you need to ask something in
class, whether it's using the bathroom,
asking for help, or borrowing a pencil,
you've got two great tools. Can and
could. Just remember, can equals casual.
Could equals polite. Add please equals
golden. Coming up next, we're switching
gears to hear a conversation between two
classmates. This one's all about
homework projects and after school
plans. Stick around. It's a good one.
Hey, Alex, did you finish the math
homework assignment? Not yet. The
algebra questions were brutal. I tried
number four like three times.
Same here. I stared at it for like 10
minutes before I even started. Want to
work on it together after school? Yeah,
that would be awesome. It's always
faster with two people. Plus, maybe we
can figure out number seven. It made
zero sense to me. Deal. Oh, did you hear
about the pop quiz in history class this
morning? No, I wasn't there. I was
absent. I had a dentist appointment. Was
it bad? Let's just say I totally guessed
on half of it. Mr. Adams didn't even
warn us. Great. Now I'm even more
behind. I should probably check the
syllabus later and catch up. Yeah, good
idea. Speaking of school stuff, do you
remember when our science project is
due? Oh, yeah. That's next Friday, I
think. We really need to start working
on it soon. For real. We've only got a
week. Why don't I meet in the library
tomorrow after class? Sounds perfect.
I'll bring my notes and maybe snacks.
Science is always better with snacks.
True. I'll bring the worksheet Miss
Parker gave us. By the way, did she
update the class schedule? Yeah, she
posted it online. We're doing lab work
on Tuesday instead of Monday. Thanks. I
always forget to check the website. All
right, so we're meeting after class
tomorrow. Yep. Library at 3:30. Don't be
late. I won't. See you then. Bye.
Okay, that was such a fun hallway chat
between Sam and Alex. It seriously
brought back memories of school life,
homework panic, last minute plans, and
of course, snacks in the library.
Totally. That conversation was full of
real everyday English that students use
with their friends. So, let's walk
through it and point out the good stuff,
the useful stuff, and the classic, why
is math like this moments. Right off the
bat, Sam asks, "Hey, did you finish the
math homework assignment?" And Alex
goes, "Ugh, not yet."
That uggh says everything. It really
does. You can feel the pain in those
algebra questions. And honestly, that
kind of natural sound. Uh, not yet. It
was brutal. That's what makes English
sound real. And then Sam suggests they
work together. Want to work on it
together after school? Now, that's a
useful phrase. You can use that with any
task. Want to do it together later?
Let's study after class. Super flexible.
Yeah, and I love how Alex responds with,
"Yeah, that would be awesome." It's
casual, friendly, and enthusiastic. The
phrase, "It's always faster with two
people," is also a cool way to say,
"Help me," without actually saying it.
Yep. Then Sam brings up something
unexpected.
Did you hear about the pop quiz in
history class this morning? That right
there, pop quiz, is a classic school
phrase. Oh yeah. If you're a student,
you know what that means. Surprise,
panic, and regret. A pop quiz is a short
test you didn't know was coming.
Teachers love them. Students, not so
much. And Alex says, "No, I wasn't
there. I was absent." That's another
great word, absent. It just means you
weren't in class. And then comes the
reason. I had a dentist appointment.
It's such a good, simple way to explain
something. I was absent yesterday. I
missed class because I was sick. It's
honest. It's polite and useful. Then
Alex says, "I should probably check the
syllabus and catch up." Now, if you're
new to that word, the syllabus is like
your course map. It tells you what
you're going to study, when things are
due, and sometimes even test dates.
Yeah, the syllabus is basically your
school survival guide. Checking it when
you miss class. Smart move, Alex. Then
they switch to talking about the science
project. Alex reminds Sam that it's due
next Friday. That phrase, due next
Friday, is another common one in
schools, right? And then comes this
lovely bit. Want to meet in the library
tomorrow after class? Love that. It's
casual but clear. And honestly, the
library is the perfect setting. Quiet,
focused, and yes, snack friendly if
you're sneaky enough.
Yeah, Alex even says, "Science is always
better with snacks." That line is so
real. It adds personality and makes the
convo feel like something you'd actually
hear in the hallway. And it's important
for learners to hear stuff like that.
Real relaxed language. It's not all
textbooks and grammar drills. Sometimes
it's just I'll bring snacks. Then we get
another school phrase. Did she update
the class schedule? The schedule is the
plan for what's happening and when. In
school, it's everything. When you have
English, when the quiz is, when your
presentation is due. Exactly. And Alex
says, "Yeah, she posted it online. Lab
is Tuesday now." So, they're using
natural vocabulary like schedule,
posted, lab, online. All very real world
and very studenty. And to wrap it up,
Sam confirms the time. So, we're meeting
after class tomorrow. Alex replies,
"Yep, library at 3:30. Don't be late."
You can really hear the friendship in
that ending. Friendly reminder, casual
goodbye. See you then. Bye. That whole
dialogue was packed with great phrases.
Did you finish the homework? Want to
work on it together? I was absent. Let's
meet at the library. Check the syllabus.
When is it due? Pop quiz. Don't be late.
And the best part, it felt like a real
conversation between two friends. Not
scripted, not stiff, just honest,
friendly English that you can learn and
use right away. If you're a student
learning English or even just someone
who wants to sound more natural, this
kind of everyday talk is where the magic
happens. And if you want to practice it,
stick around. We've got a speaking
challenge coming up next. And it's your
turn to try some of these phrases out
loud. Let's do it together, just like
Sam and Alex. Great idea. All right,
learners. Ready to speak? We'll guide
you through it right after this. It's
speaking challenge time. Get ready to
repeat some key phrases from today's
dialogue. We'll say the sentence first,
then you repeat after us. Nice and
simple. Okay, here's the first one. Did
you finish the math homework assignment?
Repeat it with us. Ready? Did you finish
the math homework assignment? Great. You
can also change the subject. Try. Did
you finish the science project? Next
one. I was absent yesterday. I had a
dentist appointment. Ready? Say it with
us nice and clear. I was absent
yesterday. I had a dentist appointment.
Now try changing it to your own reason.
For example, I was absent because I
wasn't feeling well. Go ahead, give it a
try.
Awesome. Okay, here's a fun one from
Alex. Science is always better with
snacks.
Love it. Let's say it together. Feel
free to smile while you speak.
Science is always better with snacks.
Nice. Here's another useful school
sentence. Let's meet at the library
after class. Let's meet at the library
after class. Last one. Don't be late.
Don't be late.
You sounded great. Seriously, if you
spoke those sentences out loud just now,
give yourself a high five. And remember,
practicing out loud, even just 5 minutes
a day, can seriously boost your speaking
skills. You can even shadow us. That
means you repeat everything we say,
almost like you're copying our rhythm
and tone. Try replaying this section
tomorrow and say the sentences again,
but a little faster and with more
confidence. All right, friends. It is
time for one of my favorite parts of the
show, listener Q&A. Yes, this is where
we answer your questions and help you
feel more confident speaking English,
especially in real situations like the
classroom.
We've got three awesome questions today
and honestly, they're so relatable. Like
every English learner has probably
thought at least one of these. Yeah,
these are the kind of questions I wish I
could have asked when I was learning a
new language. So, let's jump in. All
right, first up, we've got a question
from Yuki in Japan. Yuki asks, "What's
the difference between recess and
break?" Ooh, great question. So, here's
the fun part. Both mean time to chill,
but they're used a little differently
depending on where you are. Yeah. In
American English, especially for little
kids, think elementary school, recess is
when you go outside, run around, maybe
have a snack or play games, it's the
best part of the day. Totally. You're
not sitting at your desk. It's time to
move. But if you're in high school,
college, or in the UK, they usually just
call it a break, right? Like, break
starts at 10:30 or let's grab something
to eat during break. So quick summary,
recess means used mostly for young kids
in the US. Break means more general and
used by older students and in British
English. Awesome question, Yuki. Okay,
next one's a good one. It's from Carlos
in Mexico, and we've all been here. Yep.
Carlos asks, "What do I say if I didn't
do my homework?"
Oh boy. All right, real talk. This
happens. Life gets busy for sure. The
key is be honest and be respectful.
Don't go full drama mode and say, "Alien
stole my notebook."
Please don't do that. Just keep it
simple like, "I'm sorry I didn't finish
my homework. I had a personal issue."
Or, "I didn't manage to complete it, but
I'll turn it in as soon as I can." And
if you just forgot, hey, we've all done
it. You can say, "I forgot to do it. I
apologize." Teachers appreciate when
you're real with them. Trust me, way
better than blaming the dog.
100%.
Okay, last one today. This is from Amina
in Egypt, and it's such a helpful one
for the classroom. She asks, "If I
didn't understand something in class,
how do I ask the teacher to repeat it?"
Yes, Amina. First of all, gold star for
asking. So many people are afraid to
speak up, but it's totally okay to ask
for clarification. Exactly. Teachers are
used to it. It shows you care about
learning. So, here are a few easy and
polite phrases. Try saying, "Excuse me,
could you repeat that, please?" Or, "I
didn't quite catch that. Can you say it
again?" Even, "Sorry, I didn't
understand. Could you explain it one
more time?" Another great one is, "Would
you mind saying that again a little more
slowly?" So polite, so useful, and hey,
you asking that question might even help
other students who didn't understand
either. Teamwork makes the classroom
work.
I love that. All right, big shout out to
Yuki, Carlos, and Amina. You guys asked
awesome questions. And hey, if you're
listening right now and you've got a
question on your mind, send it in. You
might hear your name in a future
episode. And that brings us to the end
of today's episode. We covered a ton of
useful classroom English. And honestly,
I kind of want to go back to school now.
Same. This episode made me miss lunch
breaks and pop quizzes. Okay, maybe not
the quizzes. Yeah, we can skip those.
But seriously, whether you're in school
now or just want to improve your
everyday English, this vocabulary is
super practical. And the best part, you
can practice right after this with our
homework challenge. That's right. So,
here's your homework. Don't worry, no
grading involved. Challenge number one,
choose three new words or phrases from
today's episode and use them in your own
sentences. Write them down or say them
out loud. And challenge number two,
practice asking for help in English. Try
saying something like, "Excuse me, could
you repeat that, please?" Say it a few
times until it feels natural. If you're
feeling bold, share your sentences with
us on YouTube, Instagram, or wherever
you're listening. And don't forget, you
can always rewind this episode, listen
again, and shadow our conversations to
improve your pronunciation. So, make
sure you hit that follow or subscribe
button so you don't miss it. Until then,
keep practicing, keep smiling, and
remember, learning English is a journey,
not a race. And we're with you every
step of the way. Thanks for hanging out
with us today. Bye, everyone. Take care,
and don't forget to raise your hand.
[Music]
Hey everyone and welcome back to the
English Phrases Hub podcast. I'm Emma
and I'm Jake. Thanks for tuning in.
Whether you're a longtime listener or
this is your first episode, we're really
glad you're here. Today's episode is all
about something we can all relate to,
family and relationships. We'll talk
about how to describe your family
members in English, introduce someone,
and even share personal stories about
the people closest to you. Yep. We'll
cover useful vocabulary like siblings,
in-laws, and phrases like get along with
or take after someone. You'll also learn
how to talk about relationships,
romantic, friendly, and everything in
between. And don't worry, this isn't a
grammar-heavy lesson. It's all about
practical English you can use everyday,
like when someone asks, "Tell me about
your family." Or, "Who are you closest
to in your family?" Exactly. And just to
kick things off, here's a fun question.
Emma, who do you take after most in your
family? Your mom or your dad? Oo, that's
easy. I take after my mom. We both love
to talk. We laugh at the same silly
jokes, and we even have the same smile.
What about you? Definitely my dad. We're
both quiet, love books, and well, we're
both early birds. No one else in my
house is awake at 6:00 a.m. But us. See,
that's what we mean. Little phrases like
take after, get along with, or be close
to are super useful when talking about
family. And today, we'll break them all
down with examples, stories, and a fun
roleplay. Plus, we'll answer a great
listener question and give you a
speaking challenge at the end. So, stick
around and let's jump in. All right,
let's get started with some useful
vocabulary for today's topic. We've got
10 words and phrases that you'll hear in
today's conversation and roleplay. We'll
go through them one by one, explain what
they mean, and give you a quick example.
If you can, try to repeat them out loud
after us to practice your pronunciation.
Okay, here's the first one. Siblings.
These are your brothers and sisters.
Example, I have three siblings, two
brothers and one sister.
Number two, in-laws. This refers to the
family of your husband or wife like your
mother-in-law, father-in-law, or
sister-in-law. Example, my in-laws are
coming over for dinner tonight.
Number three, extended family. This
includes aunts, uncles, cousins,
grandparents, everyone beyond your
immediate family. Example, we have a big
extended family gathering every summer.
Number four, get along with. This means
to have a good relationship with
someone. Example, I really get along
with my cousin. We talk all the time.
Number five, take after. This means you
are similar to someone in your family in
looks, personality, or habits. Example,
she takes after her dad. They're both
very organized.
Number six, close-knit. This describes a
family or group that is very close and
supportive. Example, my family is really
close-knit. We talk every day. Number
seven, single parent. A person who
raises a child alone without a partner.
Example, he grew up in a single parent
household.
Number eight, only child. Someone who
doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
Example, I'm an only child, so I spent a
lot of time with my parents.
Number nine, married, divorced, or
widowed. These are relationship status
words. Example, my uncle is divorced.
Example, my grandparents have been
married for 50 years.
Number 10, childhood. The time when you
were a child. Example, my childhood was
full of fun family holidays.
You'll hear most of these in our
dialogue today, so try to remember a few
and think about how they relate to your
own life. And if you're using the
transcript, you can highlight or write
down the ones you didn't know before.
All right, ready for a bit of grammar?
Let's move on to today's grammar
spotlight. We're keeping it simple and
super useful. We're focusing on
possessive adjectives and how to
describe people using have and be. Yep.
These are phrases you use every day when
you talk about your family. Let's start
with possessive adjectives. Words like
my, your, his, her, our, and their. Here
are a few quick examples. My brother is
tall. Her grandmother lives in London.
their parents speak Spanish. You can use
these to talk about anyone in your
family. Just remember, my for yourself,
your for the person you're speaking to,
his or her for one person, our for you
and someone else, and their for more
than one person. All right. Now, let's
talk about describing people. We often
use two verbs, to have and to be. We use
have for things like my dad has brown
eyes. She has two sisters. I have a big
family. And we use be for personality
and characteristics.
My sister is very friendly. They are
quiet. He is funny and smart. Let's try
combining them. Example, my uncle has a
beard. He is really kind. or her brother
has two kids. He is married. Here's a
tip. When you describe family members,
think of what they have, appearance,
things, and what they are. Personality,
status. That's right. And don't worry,
we'll show you how this works naturally
in our upcoming dialogue. Listen for
those possessive words and the use of
have and be while Jake and I talk about
our families. Okay, ready for a real
life conversation? Let's dive into the
role play. Okay, so in this next part,
Jake and I are going to do a short role
play. We're two friends catching up at a
cafe and talking about our families. As
you listen, try to notice the vocabulary
and grammar we introduced earlier,
especially the words like siblings, get
along with, and take after. Right? And
remember, if you have the transcript
open, feel free to follow along and
don't be afraid to pause and repeat
after us. So, Jake, how is your family
doing? They're good, thanks. My parents
just got back from a short trip to the
countryside. They love taking weekend
breaks. Nice. How about your sister?
What's she up to these days? She's still
living in New York. She's working as a
graphic designer now. We text almost
every day. We really get along well.
That's great. I don't have any siblings,
so I'm kind of an only child, but I'm
really close to my cousins. We grew up
together. Yeah, that's cool. Are you
more like your mom or your dad? H I
think I take after my dad. We both love
music and we're super organized. What
about you? I'm a mix. I have my mom's
sense of humor, but I definitely got my
dad's love for books. Oh, and my little
niece. She just started school. A,
that's so sweet. Is she your sister's
daughter? Yep, she's five now. Super
curious and always asking questions.
Sounds like someone else I know.
Guilty. What about your parents? Are
they retired? Not yet. My mom still
works part-time at the library and my
dad teaches math. They're pretty active.
We're a close-knit family. That's
awesome. I think having a strong family
bond makes such a difference. Totally
agree. Design. Did you hear some of
those key phrases? We used siblings,
only child, take after, get along with,
close-knit family, and more. If you
missed anything, don't worry. We'll go
over some of the vocabulary and cultural
tips in just a moment. All right, let's
pause for a moment and go a bit deeper.
In the conversation you just heard, Jake
and I used a few phrases that might
sound simple, but they carry a lot of
meaning when you think about how family
works in different cultures. Exactly.
So, let's talk about that. Because in
English, when we say things like
siblings, in-laws, or extended family,
we're not just giving names to people.
We're also describing how relationships
work, what's considered normal, and
sometimes even what's expected of us.
Let's start with something basic. Moving
out. In many English-speaking countries
like the US, Canada, the UK, and
Australia, it's pretty common for people
to move out of their parents' home when
they're around 18 or 19. Sometimes it's
for college, sometimes for work, or just
for independence. Yeah, I moved out when
I was 19, and I remember it felt like a
big step. But in other countries, that
would be unusual. In places like India,
Italy, or many parts of Latin America,
people often live with their parents
much longer, even into their 30s. And
it's completely normal, right? In fact,
in some cultures, it's expected.
Families often live together, not just
parents and kids, but grandparents,
aunts, uncles, and that's where we get
the term extended family. In English,
when we say extended family, we mean all
the relatives outside your immediate
family, which is just your parents and
siblings. And how about
responsibilities? In some cultures,
family means support, emotional,
financial, and even physical. It's very
common to help out with child care,
elder care, and even share income. In
English-speaking cultures, there's
usually a stronger focus on individual
independence, though, of course, that
can vary a lot from family to family.
That's true. I remember a student once
asked me, "Why do people in American
movies always say,"I love you," to their
parents. We don't really say that in my
country. We just show it in actions. And
that's a great point. In English,
especially in the US, saying I love you
or I'm proud of you is more verbal. It's
part of the language culture.
Absolutely. And that's why learning a
language is about more than just
vocabulary and grammar. It's about
understanding how people connect and
express feelings. For example, someone
might say, "We're a close-knit family."
That doesn't just mean they live
together. It means they trust each
other, talk openly, and support each
other emotionally. Let's talk about
in-laws, too. That's a word that
sometimes confuses learners. Your
in-laws are your husband or wife's
family. So, your mother-in-law is your
spouse's mom. Your sister-in-law is your
spouse's sister or even your brother's
wife. It depends on the context. And
here's a cultural tip. In many
English-speaking countries, people
usually call their in-laws by their
first names. So, instead of
mother-in-law, you might say, "Hi,
Susan." But in other cultures, it's more
formal. You might say Mrs. or use a
title of respect. And another fun point,
in English, we don't really have
different words for relatives on the
mother's side versus the father's side.
But in other languages like Arabic,
Hindi or Chinese, you often have
completely different terms for those.
Let's also talk about how people
describe relationships. For example, in
English, we often say things like, "I'm
really close to my dad. I don't get
along with my cousin." Or, "My brother
and I used to fight a lot, but now we're
best friends." Those phrases, be close
to, get along with, used to, they're
simple but powerful and they help you
talk about your personal experiences,
not just facts. Exactly. And even though
people may have very different family
structures or traditions, one thing is
true everywhere. Relationships matter.
Whether you're an only child, part of a
big extended family, or living far from
home, how you connect with others shapes
your daily life. So, here's a question
for our listeners. What's one tradition
or relationship custom from your culture
that you'd like to share in English?
Maybe your family eats dinner together
every night. Maybe you have a holiday
where everyone visits grandparents. Or
maybe you call your cousin your best
friend. Whatever it is, think about how
you could describe that in English using
some of the vocabulary from today. And
if you're up for it, write it down, say
it out loud, or share it with us on
social media. We love hearing from you
and learning from you, too. All right.
Instead of jumping into questions, how
about we do another roleplay? Yes. Let's
call this one meeting the family. And in
this scene, Jake has bringed his
girlfriend Emma to meet his parents for
the very first time. It's a classic
situation full of small talk, polite
introductions, and of course, a little
bit of pressure. Exactly. This will help
you practice how to introduce someone,
describe your family and background, and
make a good first impression in English.
So, in this scene, I'm Jake. Emma is my
girlfriend, and you'll hear my mom and
dad as well. Let's dive in.
Okay, deep breath. Ready to meet the
parents?
As ready as I'll ever be. Do I have
something in my teeth? Nope. You look
perfect. Just be yourself. They're going
to love you. Door opens. Jake's mom and
dad appear. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. I'd like
you to meet Emma. Emma, this is my mom,
Susan, and my dad, Robert. It's so nice
to meet you both. Jake's told me so much
about you. Oh, we've heard a lot about
you, too, Emma. Welcome. We're happy to
finally meet you in person. Yes. Welcome
to our home. Please come in and make
yourself comfortable. Thank you. It
smells amazing in here. Are you cooking?
Oh, yes. Just making Jake's favorite
lasagna. He said it's your favorite,
too. It is. That's so thoughtful. I grew
up eating lasagna every Friday. It
reminds me of home. Emma's from Toronto.
She moved here a couple of years ago.
Toronto, lovely city. I went there once
on a business trip. So, Emma, what do
you do? I work as a graphic designer for
a marketing company downtown. It's
creative and every project is different.
I love it. That sounds exciting. And
what about your family? Are they still
in Canada?
Yes, they are. I'm the youngest. I have
two older brothers and my parents live
just outside the city. We're very close.
We have a video call every Sunday, no
matter what. That's wonderful. The
family is so important, isn't it?
Absolutely. I was raised in a close-knit
family, so staying connected means
everything to me. It's the same for us.
Jake is really close to his sister. They
text almost every day. Yeah, we've
always gotten along. She actually helped
me plan this dinner.
She was so excited when she heard you
were bringing someone special home.
That's really sweet. I'd love to meet
her sometime. I'm sure you will. She's
coming by next weekend. Maybe you two
can join us for brunch. That sounds
great. What do you think, Em?
I'd love that. Thank you so much for
making me feel welcome. Of course. We're
happy to have you. Now, let's head to
the dining room. Dinner's almost ready.
Perfect timing. And just wait till you
try mom's garlic bread.
Now I'm extra excited. And
scene. That was a fun one.
And very real. That's the kind of
English people actually use in everyday
life. Polite greetings, small talk, and
showing interest in others. Exactly.
This will help you practice how to
introduce someone, describe your family
and background, and make a good first
impression in English. So, in this
scene, I'm Jake, Emma's my girlfriend,
and you'll hear my mom and dad as well.
Let's go over a few of the useful
phrases from that role play. For
example, make yourself comfortable or
make yourself at home. A polite way to
say to a guest, "We've heard a lot about
you." a friendly way to show interest
when meeting someone new. A close-knit
family, a family that stays emotionally
close and supports one another. We get
along, meaning you have a good
relationship with someone.
And also phrases like, "She's my
girlfriend." Or, "This is my mom." Those
are simple but super helpful when
introducing people. And did you hear how
we used small compliments to break the
ice? like, "It smells amazing in here."
or "That's so thoughtful." These little
things make conversations warmer.
Exactly. And the more you practice these
conversations, the easier it becomes to
feel confident even in new and formal
situations like meeting a partner's
family. So, if you're listening, try to
imagine this situation happening in your
life. What would you say? How would you
describe your job, your family, or where
you're from? And here's a fun idea. Try
to recreate this dialogue with a friend,
teacher, or language partner. You can
even change the names or switch roles.
All right, up next, let's answer a great
question from one of our listeners about
how to describe family trees in English.
Today, we have a fantastic one from
Anukica in Germany. Here's Anukica's
question. How can I describe my family
tree in English? Sometimes I get
confused with words like cousins, great
aunts, and in-laws. That's a great
question, Anukica, and one that many
learners of English often ask.
Describing your family in English can be
a bit tricky because there are so many
specific words for different family
members. But don't worry, once you
understand the basic structure, it'll
all start to make sense. Let's break it
down. First, we'll start with the
immediate family, which includes the
people closest to you. Parents, your mom
and dad. Simple, right? Siblings, your
brothers and sisters. Children, your
sons and daughters. Exactly. These are
the people you would live with or the
ones you have the closest relationship
with. Next, we get into the extended
family. That's when things start to get
interesting, right? So moving out from
the center of your family, you have
grandparents, your parents' parents,
aunt and uncles, your mom's or dad's
brothers and sisters. Cousins, the
children of your aunts and uncles. So
your cousin is, for example, your mom's
sister's child. Now let's move to the
next generation. If you're talking about
your great aunt, that's your
grandmother's sister. And if you're
talking about your greatgrandparents,
that's your grandparents' parents. And
the great prefix goes on. For example,
your greatuncle is your
greatgrandmother's brother, and your
great cousins would be the children of
your great aunts or great uncles. It
sounds a bit complicated, but remember,
we're just adding great before the
regular terms to describe someone from a
previous generation.
Now let's talk about in-laws. This is
another important part of a family tree.
Exactly. In-laws are the relatives you
gain through marriage. For example, your
husband's or wife's mother is your
mother-in-law. Your husband's or wife's
father is your father-in-law.
Their siblings are your brother-in-law
and sister-in-law. And here's an
example. If your brother marries
someone, that person becomes your
sister-in-law. If your husband's sister
gets married, her husband becomes your
brother-in-law. In-laws are people you
are related to by marriage, not by
blood. If you want to get a little more
specific, you can say maternal for your
mother's side of the family and paternal
for your father's side of the family.
For example, your maternal grandmother
is your mom's mom and your paternal
grandfather is your dad's father. That's
a good tip. It's especially helpful if
you're talking about a family tree or a
family history and you need to be clear
about whether you're talking about your
mom's side or your dad's side. You could
say something like, "On my maternal
side, I have two aunts and on my
paternal side, I have one uncle." Now,
let's put it all together in a
conversation.
Imagine you're describing your family to
a new friend. You might say something
like, "I have a small family. I'm the
youngest of three siblings. My parents
live in another city, and I have a
cousin who lives in New York. My aunt
and uncle are visiting this weekend. On
my mom's side, I have two brothers and
one sister." Or you could say, "My
family is pretty big. I have an older
brother and a younger sister. My
grandparents are from Italy and my
greatuncle still lives there. My brother
is married and his wife is my
sister-in-law. I also have three
cousins, two on my dad's side and one on
my mom's side." That's right. You can
also say things like, "I come from a
close-knit family to describe a family
that is very close to one another." Or
you could use, "My family is spread out
across the country if you don't live
close to everyone." And don't forget,
family trees don't just have to be about
blood relatives. You can also talk about
chosen family, the people you consider
family, even though you're not related
by blood. That's true. So, you could
say, "Even though we're not related by
blood, I consider my best friend my
sister." Great example. So, now you
should feel more confident describing
your family in English. It's all about
knowing the terms and using them in the
right context. We hope that answers your
question, Anukica. And for anyone else
listening, remember family vocabulary
can be a little complicated, but with
practice it becomes second nature. If
you have more questions, we're always
happy to help. Just leave a comment on
our YouTube channel. Thank you for the
awesome question, Anukica. It's always a
pleasure to dive into topics that help
you feel more comfortable in everyday
conversations. All right, it's time for
one of our favorite parts of the
episode, the speaking challenge. This is
where we invite you, the listener, to
take what you've learned today and
actually speak English. You can do this
alone, with a friend, or even send it to
us if you'd like. So, here's today's
challenge. Describe two members of your
family using some of the vocabulary and
grammar from today's episode. You can
talk about what they look like, what
kind of person they are, what they do,
and how you're related. Try using
phrases like, "I get along with, "She
takes after, he has, we're really close.
She's my cousin on my mom's side."
Here's an example from me. My sister
Emily takes after our mom. She's kind,
talkative, and super creative. We've
always gotten along well, even when we
were kids. She has two daughters, and
I'm their favorite uncle, of course.
Nice. Okay, here's mine. My dad is
really calm and patient. He's the kind
of person who never raises his voice. He
has green eyes and gray hair, and he
loves gardening. I take after him in
that way. We both enjoy quiet time and
nature. See, it doesn't have to be long
or complicated. Just two or three
sentences about someone in your family
using today's vocabulary. The more you
speak, the more natural it becomes. You
can even record yourself and listen
back. Or better yet, send us a voice
note on Instagram or tag us in a video
using the hashtag Englishphraseshub
challenge. We'd love to feature your
responses in a future episode. And don't
worry about making mistakes. That's how
we learn. The important thing is to
speak and keep practicing. So, go ahead,
describe someone special in your family.
And if you're feeling extra brave,
describe two people. We'll also have
this challenge written out in the
episode notes along with a vocabulary
list and a few sample answers to help
you get started. All right, we've
covered a lot today, so let's go through
a full recap before we wrap up, just to
make sure everything sinks in. We
started off with some essential family
related vocabulary, words and
expressions you can use in everyday
conversations like siblings, in-laws,
extended family, and only child. We also
introduced some really helpful phrases
like get along with, take after, and be
close to. These phrases make your
English sound more natural and personal.
Then we moved on to some important
grammar basics, focusing on how to
describe your family clearly and
correctly. We talked about possessive
adjectives like my, his, her, our, and,
these are small words, but they're used
constantly when you're talking about
your family and relationships. Then we
reviewed how to use have and be to talk
about appearance and personality. So for
example, she has long hair. He is very
funny. These simple structures help you
build descriptive sentences with ease.
Next, we brought those words and grammar
to life in not just one, but two full
role plays. The first was a casual
conversation between friends catching up
and talking about their families. Great
for practicing informal everyday
English. The second role play was all
about meeting the family, a realistic
situation where you're introducing your
partner to your parents. That one gave
you a chance to hear polite language,
family descriptions, and small talk in
action. And we didn't stop there. We
also explored some really interesting
cultural insights. We looked at how
family structures vary around the world
from nuclear families to large extended
families. We talked about the idea of
being part of a close-knit family, how
people introduce others in
English-speaking cultures, and how terms
like in-laws work differently across
languages and traditions. Then we moved
into our listener Q&A where we answered
Anka's great question about how to
describe a family tree in English. We
went through terms like aunts, uncles,
cousins, greatgrandparents, and even
explained maternal versus paternal
relatives. We also talked about in-law
relationships like sister-in-law or
father-in-law, and shared examples so
you can confidently talk about your
family members, whether they're blood
relatives or part of your chosen family.
And finally, we gave you a speaking
challenge to put it all into practice.
Remember, describe two people in your
family using today's vocabulary and try
to use full sentences. You can find
today's transcript, vocabulary list, and
a downloadable worksheet in the
description. Thank you so much for
spending time with us. We really hope
you enjoyed learning new phrases,
exploring family vocabulary, and
listening to the role plays. And

Hello everyone and welcome to English
Phrases Hub. My name is Emma and I'm
Jake. Today we've got a practical
English lesson that's all about real
life situations and it's especially
helpful if you've ever needed to talk
about your health in English. That's
right. This episode is focused on
medical English vocabulary in phrases
and it's perfect for beginner to
intermediate learners. Whether you're
visiting a doctor, going to the
pharmacy, or just trying to explain how
you feel, these phrases are going to
help you communicate clearly and
confidently.
The theme for today's first dialogue is
health and everyday medical situations,
and we'll be walking through four
realistic dialogues that cover different
parts of a medical visit, from checkups
and symptoms to pharmacy conversations
and nurse interactions. We'll introduce
common vocabulary, explain key
expressions, and even break down some
idioms people use when they're sick or
feeling unwell. Before we jump into our
first dialogue, let's go over a few
important words and phrases you'll hear
throughout the episode. These are really
helpful when you go to the doctor, visit
a pharmacy, or just need to talk about
your health in English. So, let's take a
quick look. Appointment. This means a
scheduled meeting with a doctor or
medical professional. For example, I
have a doctor's appointment at 300 p.m.
You can also say, I need to make an
appointment with the dentist. This word
is key when you call a clinic or
hospital. You're not just going to the
doctor. You're making an appointment or
having an appointment. It helps keep
everything organized and on time.
Symptom is a sign that something is
wrong with your body or health. Examples
of symptoms are headache, fever, sore
throat, or cough. You might say, "My
symptom is a headache or I have flu
symptoms."
It's okay if you don't know how to
explain exactly what's wrong. Just
describing your symptoms is a great
start, and doctors understand this kind
of language. You can use simple phrases
like I feel sick or I have a stomach
ache. Prescription. This is the medicine
that a doctor tells you to take. It's
not something you just grab from a
store. For example, the doctor gave me a
prescription for antibiotics.
You can also say, "I need to pick up my
prescription from the pharmacy."
And remember, some medicine is
prescription only, meaning you need the
doctor's written order, while others are
over- theounter, which you can buy
without one. We'll hear both phrases
today. Dosage. This is the amount of
medicine you should take and how often.
For example, take one tablet twice a
day. That's the dosage. You'll hear this
word a lot atarmacies or when reading
the label on medicine bottles.
Practical. Always follow the dosage
instructions carefully, especially if
the medicine says things like, "Do not
exceed four tablets in 24 hours." That's
an important safety note. And finally,
checkup. This is a general medical exam
to make sure you're healthy. You might
hear, "I'm going in for a routine
checkup." or I had my annual checkup
last week. Encouraging. A checkup is
usually done when you don't feel sick.
It's just to stay healthy and catch any
small problems early. Some people also
call it a physical. All right, that's a
solid foundation. You now know five
useful terms and we'll be using them in
our conversations coming up. Great. Now
that we have those ready, let's head
into our first dialogue. visiting the
doctor's office. Listen carefully and
try to spot these words in context.
Good morning, Jake. How can I help you
today? Hi, doctor. I've been feeling
really unwell since last night. I have a
high fever around 102° F and a horrible
dry cough. My throat is sore and I'm
just exhausted. M, that doesn't sound
fun at all. Have you had any other
symptoms? Nausea, headache, bodyaches?
Yeah, actually, my head has been
pounding since this morning. I also feel
a little dizzy and I haven't had much of
an appetite. All right. It sounds like
you might be coming down with the flu.
Let me check your temperature and listen
to your lungs. Okay, sure. Go ahead. Hm.
Your temperature is definitely high and
I can hear some congestion in your
lungs. You're probably dealing with a
viral infection, possibly influenza.
Brr, I feel cold even though I know I
have a fever. That's quite common. Your
body is trying to fight off the
infection. I'm going to prescribe some
antiviral medication and recommend you
take paracetamol or ibuprofen for the
fever and bodyaches. Also, make sure to
rest and drink lots of fluids. Water,
warm teas, and clear soup are all
helpful. Thanks, doctor. Should I stay
home from work? Absolutely. I'll write
you a medical note for your employer.
Take at least 3 days off and don't
return to work until your fever is
completely gone. You don't want to
spread it to others or push your body
too hard. Here you go, your prescription
and your time off note. You can pick up
the medicine at any nearby pharmacy. If
your symptoms don't improve in 3 to 5
days, or if they get worse, please call
the clinic right away. I'd like to
schedule a follow-up just in case. We'll
do. Thank you so much. I'll rest, take
the meds, and stay bundled up. Good
plan. Feel better soon, Mark. I hope
next time I see you, you'll be fit as a
fiddle. That's the goal. Thanks again,
doctor.
That dialogue had lots of useful
expressions you'll probably hear or even
say during a real visit to the doctor's
office. Let's walk through some of the
important words and phrases together.
For example, I said, "Come on in." which
is a friendly and casual way to invite
someone into a room. It's commonly used
by doctors, nurses, or even friends.
Much nicer than just saying enter. It
makes the patient feel welcome and
relaxed. You probably also noticed the
word fever, which simply means a high
body temperature, usually a sign of
infection. In the dialogue, Mark said,
"I have a fever of 102° F." That's quite
high. If you're in a country that uses
Celsius, that's about 38.9°
C. He also mentioned a dry cough, which
is a common symptom when you have a cold
or flu. A dry cough means there's no
mucus. It's just irritating and
scratchy. You can describe other types,
too, like a wet cough or persistent
cough. Right? And I use the phrase over
theounter when talking about medicine.
This means medicine you can buy without
a prescription. For example, you can
take over-the-counter pain relievers
like ibuprofen. Common over-the-counter
items include vitamins, cold medicine,
and painkillers. Let's also talk about
prescription. That's the medicine your
doctor officially recommends. It usually
comes with a printed note or code that
the pharmacy uses to give you the
correct drug. In many countries, some
medications can only be purchased with a
prescription, especially antibiotics or
stronger treatments. We also said rest
and fluids. This is a typical
recommendation when you're sick. Fluids
means drinks like water, herbal tea, or
soup. And rest means exactly what it
sounds like, staying home, sleeping, and
letting your body recover. And don't
forget the setting. Most people will be
in the waiting room before the
appointment. You usually check in at the
reception desk, then wait until the
doctor calls your name. So, if someone
says, "The doctor will see you now, it's
your turn." Now, here's one of my
favorite parts, the idioms. In the
dialogue, I said, "I hope you feel fit
as a fiddle." This is a cheerful idiom
that means very healthy or in great
shape. You can say this to someone after
they've been sick, like, "Glad to see
you're fit as a fiddle again." Right?
And I used the phrase under the weather
from earlier. It's a gentle, casual way
to say you're feeling a little sick. Not
terrible, just not your usual self. For
example, I think I'll stay home today.
I'm feeling a bit under the weather. And
no, it doesn't mean you're literally
standing outside in a rainstorm with the
flu. Yeah. Please don't stand under any
weather forecast holding a thermometer
and wondering why your nose is stuffy.
That's not how it works.
Yeah, exactly. Idioms aren't meant to be
taken literally. That's what makes them
fun and sometimes confusing. But once
you get the hang of them, they make your
English sound more natural. And the good
news, you're already learning and using
them, which means you're making great
progress. All right. Next up, we'll go
through a dialogue at the pharmacy where
someone is picking up a prescription.
You'll hear common expressions like fill
a prescription, dosage, and side
effects. All super useful if you ever
need to get medicine or speak with a
pharmacist in an English-speaking
country. And maybe we'll find out if
Mark actually follows the instructions
or ends up drinking cough syrup with
coffee.
Let's hope not. Stick with us. The
pharmacy scene is coming up next.
Good afternoon. Welcome to Green Leaf
Pharmacy. How can I help you today? Hi,
I'm here to pick up a prescription that
was sent over by Dr. Sarah. It should be
under the name Mark Taylor. All right,
Mark. Let me take a quick look.
Yes, I see it here. Dr. Sarah sent over
a prescription for flu treatment. one
bottle of cough syrup and a pack of
fever reducing tablets. That's right.
She said it should help with my cough
and fever. I've been feeling pretty
awful since last night. I'm sorry to
hear that. Don't worry. This should help
ease your symptoms. Let me explain how
to take everything. For the cough syrup,
take one teaspoon, that's 5 ml, three
times a day. It's best after meals so
it's easier on your stomach. For the
tablets, take one tablet every 6 hours,
but no more than four tablets in 24
hours. Okay, that's manageable. Are
there any side effects I should look out
for? Yes, good question. The most common
side effect is drowsiness. It might make
you feel sleepy. So, don't drive or do
anything that requires full
concentration while you're taking the
syrup. Also, avoid taking any other cold
or flu medicine that contains
paracetamol. You don't want to take too
much by accident. Right, that makes
sense. I'll double check my medicine
cabinet at home before taking anything
else. And how much is it? Let's see.
Your total is $10, but your insurance
covers part of it. So, your co-pay today
is just $3. That's good news. Here you
go. Thank you. One more thing, your
prescription includes one refill. So, if
you're still not feeling well after a
few weeks or if your symptoms return,
you can get more without seeing the
doctor again. Just give us a call before
you come in and we'll prepare it for
you. That's really helpful. I'll keep
that in mind. Dr. Sarah told me to rest
and drink lots of fluids, too. So, I
guess I'll be spending the next few days
on the couch with tea and soup. That's a
good plan. Stay hydrated and get plenty
of rest. And if your symptoms get worse
or last more than a few days, don't
hesitate to call your doctor again.
Thanks, Nita. I really appreciate your
help. You're very welcome, Mark. I hope
you feel better soon and that you'll be
back to feeling fit as a fiddle in no
time.
That's exactly what Dr. Sarah said.
Fingers crossed. Thanks again. Have a
good day. You, too. Take care and get
well soon.
Okay, that was a great follow-up
conversation. Mark visited the pharmacy
to pick up his prescription from Dr.
Sarah. And if you've ever had to speak
to a pharmacist in English, this
dialogue is packed with helpful language
you'll definitely want to remember.
Yeah. And this time we're going to
highlight only the new vocabulary and
phrases that didn't come up in the
doctor's visit. In that pharmacy
dialogue, we heard the word pharmacist.
That's the person who fills
prescriptions. And pharmacy is the place
where you go to buy medicine.
Next up is co-ay. If you have health
insurance, the co-ay is the part of the
bill you still have to pay yourself. For
example, Mark paid just $3 because his
insurance covered the rest. Refill. A
refill means you can get more of the
same medicine without needing a new
prescription. It's common with ongoing
medications. Nina told Mark, "Your
prescription includes one refill next
month."
We also heard the word drowsiness, which
is a side effect that means feeling
sleepy or tired after taking some
medicine, especially cold or flu
medications like cough syrup. So, Nina
warned Mark not to drive or do anything
that requires full focus.
Another important tip she gave was about
paracetamol. That's a common ingredient
in many flu and cold medicines. In the
US, it's also called acetaminophen.
Taking too much paracetamol can be
dangerous, so it's important not to
combine medicines that both contain it.
And speaking of combining, the phrase
double the dosage came up when Nina
warned Mark not to take other cough
medications at the same time. That means
taking too much of a medicine, which can
be risky. And if you didn't catch it
earlier, dosage refers to how much
medicine you take and how often. For
example, one tablet every 6 hours. At
the end of the conversation, Nenah used
the idiom fit as a fiddle again, just
like Dr. Sarah did in dialogue one. So,
we won't explain it again, but it's nice
to see how naturally idioms can pop up
in everyday conversations.
Let's go over a few real phrases you can
use when talking to a pharmacist. I'm
here to pick up a prescription.
Can you explain how to take this? Are
there any side effects? Does this
include a refill? How much is the copay?
These are great phrases to practice out
loud. Try repeating them a few times
until they feel natural. And even
better, try using them in a roleplay
with a friend or tutor. And remember,
the more you hear these words in real
conversations, the easier they'll be to
remember. That's why these dialogues are
such a helpful way to learn. Next time
you're picking up medicine, just try not
to say, "Can I get extra paracetamol for
my fiddle?"
Jake, no. That's not how idioms work.
All right. Now, let's listen to the
third dialogue, talking to a nurse.
After that, we'll come back to break it
down together.
Hi there, Sam. I'm nurse Lena, and I'll
be taking care of you today. How are you
feeling? Not so great, to be honest. My
throat is really sore, and I've been
feeling laded since this morning. I'm
sorry to hear that. Let's start by
checking your vital signs. Okay, I'll
take your blood pressure and temperature
first. I She gently places the cuff on
his arm. Okay. I'm a little nervous,
actually. I haven't been to the hospital
in a long time. That's completely
normal. A lot of people feel that way.
Just take a deep breath and try to
relax. She checks the monitor. Your
blood pressure looks normal. That's
good. Your temperature is 99° F, which
is just slightly above normal. It could
be from the sore throat. Yeah. I've also
been feeling a bit dizzy, especially
when I stand up too quickly. That could
be due to mild dehydration. Have you
been drinking enough fluids like water
or juice? Yeah, I've had some juice and
water this morning, but maybe not
enough. All right. If you continue to
feel laded, we can set up an IV drip to
help you rehydrate more quickly. It's a
simple and effective way to give your
body the fluids it needs. That sounds
helpful. I've just been feeling really
weak today. That's okay. You're in the
right place now. The doctor will be with
you shortly, but in the meantime, I want
to make sure you're as comfortable as
possible. Would you like anything? Maybe
a glass of water, a blanket, or some
tissues. A glass of water would be
great. Thank you. And maybe a blanket.
I've been feeling a bit chilly. Coming
right up. And by the way, you look a
little off color. That usually means a
bit pale or tired looking. It's nothing
to worry about, just a sign your body's
a little rund down. Yeah, I've
definitely been pushing myself too hard
lately. Well, now's the time to let your
body rest and recover. You're doing
fine, Sam. Just hang in there and we'll
help you get back on your feet. Thanks,
Nurse Lena. I appreciate your kindness.
Of course. I'll be back shortly with
that water and blanket. If you need
anything else, just press the call
button. Okay, got it. Thanks again.
All right, that was a great hospital
scene between Sam and Nurse Lena. It's
such a common situation. You're not
feeling well, you're nervous, and the
nurse is your first point of contact.
Exactly. And nurses usually ask
questions, check your condition, and
make sure you're comfortable while you
wait for the doctor. Let's break down
some of the new vocabulary and
expressions from that dialogue. First
up, you probably heard Lena say she was
going to check Sam's vital signs. That's
a medical term that refers to your basic
body functions like your blood pressure,
temperature, heart rate, and breathing
rate. Right? In this case, she checked
his blood pressure with a cuff and told
him his temperature was 99° F, which is
slightly above normal, but not too
serious. And Sam also mentioned feeling
lightaded. That means a bit dizzy or
weak, like your head is spinning or you
might faint. Nurse Lena asked if he was
dehydrated. That's when your body
doesn't have enough fluids. It can make
you feel tired, dizzy, or give you a
headache, especially if you haven't been
drinking water. And that brings us to
another useful term, IV drip, or just
IV. It stands for intravenous, and it's
when you get fluids or medicine through
a small tube directly into your vein.
It's common in hospitals when you need
quick rehydration or medication. Then
nurse Lena asked if Sam wanted a
blanket, tissues, or a glass of water.
These are small comforts, but they help
the patient feel cared for. Nurses often
check if you're cold or need anything
while you wait for the doctor. And did
you notice when she said you look a
little off color? That's an idiom. If
someone looks off color, it means they
appear pale, tired, or just not quite
right. It's a polite way to say someone
looks unwell. It doesn't mean their skin
has literally changed color. It just
means something seems a bit off with
their appearance.
Exactly. And I love how Lena ended the
dialogue with encouragement. She said,
"Hang in there. You're doing fine."
That's a supportive phrase we use when
someone is sick or going through
something difficult. It means stay
strong or be patient. Things will get
better. And Sam's response was great,
too. He thanked the nurse and said he
appreciated her kindness. Just a simple,
polite response that goes a long way.
So, if you're ever in a clinic or
hospital setting and you don't feel your
best, you now know how to describe your
symptoms clearly and respond politely.
Just like Sam. Let's quickly review a
few of today's new words and phrases.
Emma, vital signs. Jake, lightaded.
Emma, dehydrated. Jake, IV drip. Emma,
off color. Jake, hang in there. Great
work today. The next and final dialogue
in our medical English series is about
describing symptoms clearly to a doctor.
This will help you feel even more
confident when talking about how you
feel. And I promise no more IVs, unless
you're just thirsty for vocabulary.
Jake, that was terrible, but kind of
clever. All right, everyone. We'll see
you in the next one.
Good morning, Lisa. I'm Dr. Adam. I
understand you've been feeling unwell.
Can you tell me what symptoms you're
experiencing? Morning, doctor. Yeah,
I've been feeling pretty rough. It
started 2 days ago. I've had a constant
headache and my throat is really sore. I
also feel exhausted even after sleeping.
All right. So, you've had a headache and
sore throat for two days. Any fever or
chills? Yes, I had a fever last night.
It wasn't super high, but I was sweating
and had chills off and on. Got it. How
about your appetite? Have you been
eating normally? Not really. I've barely
eaten anything since yesterday. I just
don't feel hungry. And when I do eat, my
stomach feels a little queasy. All
right. So, we'll add loss of appetite
and mild nausea. Are you experiencing
any coughing or shortness of breath? A
little bit of a dry cough, but nothing
major. No chest pain or anything. Any
other symptoms you've noticed? Body
aches, fatigue, or maybe a runny nose?
Yeah, actually my whole body feels achy,
like I've done a workout even though I
haven't. And I've definitely felt more
tired than usual. I also woke up with a
runny nose this morning. Okay, thank you
for describing that clearly. That's
really helpful. Just to confirm, you're
dealing with headache, sore throat,
fatigue, chills, loss of appetite, mild
nausea, dry cough, body aches, and a
runny nose. Yeah, that pretty much sums
it up. It sounds like you're likely
dealing with a viral infection, possibly
the flu or a similar illness. I'll check
your temperature and listen to your
lungs next, just to be thorough. Then we
can discuss treatment and next steps.
Thanks, doctor. I was starting to worry
it might be something serious. That's
totally understandable, but based on
what you've described, it sounds
manageable. Let's get you feeling
better.
That was such a useful and realistic
conversation between Lisa and Dr. Adam.
Describing your symptoms clearly is one
of the most important things you can do
when you visit a doctor. And this
dialogue gave us a lot of good language
to work with. Absolutely. If you've ever
felt sick and had to explain how you
feel in English, this kind of vocabulary
is essential. So, let's go over the key
words and phrases that popped up slowly
and clearly. Let's start with headache.
That's pain in your head. Lisa said she
had a constant headache, which means the
pain didn't stop. It was always there.
And she also mentioned a sore throat.
That's when it hurts to swallow or talk,
usually because of a cold or flu.
Dr. Adam asked if she had fever or
chills. A fever means your body
temperature is too high, and chills are
when you feel really cold and shiver
even if you're warm. These two often go
together.
Another good phrase Lisa used was loss
of appetite. That means she didn't feel
like eating. It's common when you're
sick. Food just doesn't sound good,
right? And she also said she felt
queasy. That means a little sick to your
stomach. Kind of like mild nausea. Not
quite vomiting, but just uncomfortable.
Dr. Adam also asked if she had shortness
of breath or chest pain. Those are more
serious symptoms doctors want to check
for right away. Then Lisa mentioned body
aches and fatigue. Body aches feel like
sore muscles or joint pain even if you
haven't done any exercise. And fatigue
means deep tiredness, not just sleepy,
but really low energy.
She also said she woke up with a runny
nose. That's when your nose keeps
dripping or leaking, usually from a cold
or allergies. And I liked how Dr. Adam
confirmed everything by repeating the
list back. Headache, sore throat,
fatigue, chills, loss of appetite,
nausea, and so on. That's something real
doctors often do, and it's also great
for learners to hear everything repeated
clearly.
So if you ever need to talk to a doctor
in English, remember just describe your
symptoms one by one using simple words.
You don't need to use big medical terms.
Even short phrases like I have a cough
or my body hurts are enough. And you
don't have to say it perfectly. Just try
to stay calm and the doctor will help
guide you through the conversation just
like Dr. Adam did with Lisa.
Let's review some of today's key
vocabulary.
Headache,
sore throat,
fever and chills,
loss of appetite,
nausea,
queasy,
body aches,
fatigue,
runny nose.
Great job following along. We hope these
dialogues are helping you feel more
confident about real life situations.
You never know when you'll need this
kind of English at home, while
traveling, or even helping someone else.
And next time you're feeling under the
weather, just don't say you're melting
with a sore brain. Stick to headache and
fatigue. Much easier.
Oh, Jake, I think you need a vocabulary
checkup. Probably. Anyway, that's all
for this episode. In this episode, we
walked through four everyday medical
situations. Visiting the doctor, picking
up a prescription, talking to a nurse,
and describing symptoms. All super
practical and useful. We also learned
great vocabulary like prescription,
dosage, drowsiness, and vital signs,
plus fun idioms like under the weather,
off color, and fit as a fiddle. These
phrases really help your English sound
natural. We hope this episode gave you
more confidence to talk about your
health in English, whether you're
learning for travel, daily life, or just
to grow your skills. And remember, you
don't need complicated words. Simple
phrases like, "My head hurts," or, "I
feel dizzy," are more than enough to be
understood. Thanks for listening to the

[Music]
Hello and welcome to the English Phrases
Hub podcast. I'm your host, Emma, and
I'm really glad you're here with me
today. Let me start by asking you
something. Have you ever had one of
those days where you just don't feel
like studying English, you open your
textbook or your app, or maybe you even
press play on a lesson, and suddenly
your mind says, "Not today." You feel
tired, distracted, maybe even
frustrated. You think, "What's the
point? I'm not improving fast enough."
If that sounds familiar, then this
episode is for you. Because today, we're
talking about something every language
learner faces at some point. Motivation.
More specifically, how to stay motivated
when learning English, even when it
feels difficult, slow, or boring. I want
to start by saying this very clearly. If
you've ever felt stuck or discouraged,
that doesn't mean you're lazy or not
smart enough. It just means you're
human. Motivation goes up and down. It's
completely normal. But the good news is
there are ways to boost it. And today
we're going to explore them together.
In this episode, I'll be sharing simple,
practical tips you can use to stay
motivated while learning English, even
if you only have 10 minutes a day. We'll
talk about how to set clear goals, build
a study routine that actually works, and
make your learning experience more fun
and meaningful. I'll even include a few
short interactive tasks and motivational
phrases along the way so you can speak
and practice as you listen.
This episode is especially for beginner
to intermediate learners. So, don't
worry if your English isn't perfect. In
fact, don't even worry about
understanding every single word. I'll
keep things clear and I'll go slowly
when needed. Think of this podcast like
a conversation between friends because
that's really what I hope it feels like.
So whether you're walking to class,
washing the dishes, or just relaxing
with your headphones, this next hour is
all about helping you feel encouraged,
confident, and excited to keep learning.
You're doing something amazing by
working on your English, and I'm here to
help you stick with it. All right, ready
to get inspired? Let's begin.
[Music]
So, let's begin with something really
important, your mindset. When we talk
about learning English, we often focus
on what to study, vocabulary, grammar,
listening skills, but we don't always
talk about how we think while we study.
And the way you think, your mindset has
a huge effect on your motivation.
Let me give you an example. Imagine two
learners. They both study for the same
amount of time. They're at the same
level. But one learner says to
themselves, "I'm so bad at this. I keep
forgetting everything. I'll never sound
fluent." The other says, "This is hard,
but I'm making progress. Every day I get
a little better." Which one do you think
feels more motivated to keep going?
Exactly. It's not about who's more
talented. It's about who believes
they're making progress. So, I want you
to start thinking this way. You don't
need to be perfect. You don't need to
memorize a hundred words a day. You just
need to keep moving forward, even in
small steps. In fact, one of my favorite
things to tell my students is this.
Progress is progress, no matter how
small. Maybe you learned one new word
today. Maybe you listened to five
minutes of English. That counts. It all
adds up. And here's something
interesting. Did you know that our
brains naturally focus more on mistakes
than successes? Psychologists have
studied this. We remember the time we
mispronounced a word or when we didn't
understand someone, but we forget to
notice the things we did right.
That's why I always encourage my
learners to look for their small wins.
Write them down if you have to. Keep a
little victory list where you track the
good things. I understood a YouTube
video without subtitles. I finally
remembered that tricky word. I said a
full sentence in English to someone
today. These little wins can keep you
going. Because when you focus on
progress, not perfection, you create a
mindset that helps motivation grow. So
before we move on, I'd like you to do
something with me. Just take a second
and think back over the past week. Can
you remember one small success you had
in English? Just one thing you did well.
Maybe you didn't notice it before, but
now that you're thinking about it,
doesn't it feel good? That's your
motivation speaking, and we're just
getting started.
Okay, let's talk about a strategy that
can completely change the way you feel
about learning English. It's one of the
most simple yet most powerful things you
can do, and that is setting clear,
specific goals. Now, I know you've
probably heard that advice before. Set
goals, write them down. It might sound
basic, but here's the truth. Most
learners skip this step. They just
think, "I want to get better at
English." That's great in theory, but if
your goal is too big or too vague, it
can feel overwhelming. And when we feel
overwhelmed, we often end up doing
nothing. Think about it like this.
Imagine someone says, "I want to be
healthy." Okay, but what does that
actually mean? Does it mean going to the
gym every day, drinking more water,
eating more vegetables? If the goal
isn't clear, it's hard to know where to
start and even harder to know if you're
making progress. It's the same with
learning English. If your goal is
something big and abstract, like I want
to speak fluently, or I want to be good
at English, your brain doesn't really
know what action to take. You'll feel
like you're always chasing something far
away, and that's exhausting. But if your
goal is specific, something like, I will
watch one English video with subtitles
every day for the next 5 days, suddenly
your brain has a plan. And when your
brain knows the plan, it's easier to
take action. So here's what I want you
to remember. A clear goal gives you
direction. A small goal gives you
motivation. When your goals are small
and clear, you'll feel successful more
often. And that success will keep you
going. Let me give you some practical
examples. Instead of saying, "I want to
improve my listening," you could say, "I
will listen to one short English podcast
every morning while I make breakfast."
Instead of, "I want to remember more
words," say, "I will write down five new
vocabulary words and review them at the
end of each day." Instead of I want to
practice speaking, try I will record
myself saying one new English sentence
every night for a week. See how specific
and manageable those are. The cool part
is when you complete a small clear goal,
you feel a little spark. That spark is
called progress and it's like fuel for
your motivation. Even if your goal is
something tiny, like reading one English
paragraph a day, you're still moving
forward. Now, I know some of you might
be thinking, "But Emma, I don't know
what goal to set. Everything feels
hard." And I get that. When you're just
starting, it's easy to feel like you're
behind. But the truth is, you don't need
to do a lot to make progress. You just
need to do something consistently. And
if you're busy, that's okay, too. Your
goal doesn't have to be big. Even 5
minutes of English a day is better than
an hour once a week. In fact, many
language experts say that short regular
study is more effective than long
occasional study. It helps your brain
learn faster and it's easier to stick
with. So, to wrap up this part, let me
say this. Start small. Be specific. Make
it simple. And don't just think about
your goal. write it down because writing
a goal makes it real. It turns your
dream into a plan. And that's exactly
what we're going to do right now.
Okay, now it's your turn. Let's take a
moment to turn everything we just talked
about into something practical,
something personal. This will only take
a minute or two, and I promise it'll
help you feel more focused and motivated
right away. So, if you can grab a
notebook, open a note on your phone, or
even just say this out loud to yourself.
I want you to set one clear, simple
English goal for the next 7 days. It
doesn't have to be anything big or
complicated. In fact, the simpler the
better. Think about your daily routine.
When could you realistically fit in a
little English practice? What's
something you enjoy doing in English?
Here are a few ideas to help you get
started. I will learn and review five
new English words each day. I will watch
one short English video with subtitles
every evening. I will write two English
sentences in my journal before bed. I
will speak English out loud for 3
minutes every day, even if it's just to
myself. It can be as short or as
specific as you want. Just make sure
it's something you can actually do,
something that fits your life, your
time, and your energy level. Now, take a
moment and write it down. Pause this
podcast if you need to. Really, I mean
it. Don't just think about it. Write it
on paper, on your phone, on a sticky
note, anywhere.
Got it? Great. You've just created your
personal English goal for the week. And
trust me, that's a powerful thing
because now you're not just hoping to
improve your English, you're actually
planning to improve it. That small step,
it makes a big difference. And if you
want to stay even more motivated, try
putting that goal somewhere you'll see
it every day, like on your wall, your
mirror, or your phone wallpaper. Seeing
it will remind you, "Hey, I'm working on
something and I'm doing great."
All right, ready to make that goal a
habit? Let's move on to our next tip.
How to build a simple routine that
actually works.
Now that you've set a clear goal for
your week, the next step is to make that
goal a part of your daily life. And that
means building a routine. I know the
word routine might sound a little
boring, but I promise you it's one of
the best tools you have to stay
motivated, especially when learning
something longterm, like a language.
Here's the thing. When you rely only on
motivation, you'll have good days and
bad days. Some mornings you'll feel
excited to learn. Other days, you won't.
That's totally normal. Motivation is
emotional and emotions change. But a
routine, a routine doesn't ask you how
you feel. It just says, "Hey, it's time
to do your 5 minutes of English." And
when you do it again and again, it
becomes part of your day, just like
brushing your teeth or drinking water.
Now, you might be wondering, Emma, how
do I actually build a routine? Great
question. Let's break it down. First,
choose a regular time. Pick a moment in
your day that feels calm, predictable,
and realistic. For example, right after
breakfast, during your bus ride to
school or work, just before going to
bed, while you're waiting in line, or
drinking your tea. It doesn't have to be
a big block of time. Even 5 to 10
minutes is enough. What matters is doing
it regularly at the same time if
possible. That's how habits form.
Second, make it super easy to start. Put
your English notebook on your desk. Save
your favorite podcast in your playlist.
Create a shortcut on your phone to a
YouTube channel you love. The easier it
is to begin, the more likely you are to
follow through. Third, keep it simple
and enjoyable. Don't pressure yourself
to do everything at once. Your routine
doesn't need to include listening,
reading, writing, speaking, and grammar
in all one session. That's too much.
Just pick one small activity per day.
Rotate them if you want to keep things
interesting. And here's a little tip I
use for myself. Link your English time
to another habit you already have. For
example, after I brush my teeth, I'll
read one paragraph in English. Or after
I eat lunch, I'll watch a short English
video. It's called habit stacking, and
it works like magic. Remember,
consistency is more important than
intensity. It's not about doing a lot
once. It's about doing a little every
day. Because every time you show up,
even for just a few minutes, you're
telling yourself, "I care about this.
I'm serious about learning, and I
believe in myself." And let me tell you,
that's where real motivation begins. So,
now that you've got your goal and you're
building your routine, how about we take
a quick break to learn something fun, a
motivational English phrase you can use
anytime you feel like giving up. Let's
do it.
All right, time for something fun. Let's
take a short break from all the tips and
routines and learn a motivational
English phrase you can use in your
everyday life, especially when you need
a little push to keep going. Today's
phrase is, "Rome wasn't built in a day."
Have you heard it before? It's a really
popular expression in English and it's
all about patience and persistence.
Let's say it together slowly.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
What does it mean? Well, the city of
Rome, which was once the center of a
huge empire, took hundreds of years to
become great. So when someone says Rome
wasn't built in a day, they're saying
big things take time. It's a reminder to
be patient with yourself and to
understand that learning, especially
learning English, is a process. It won't
happen all at once, and that's perfectly
okay. Here's how you might hear the
phrase in real life. I'm still
struggling with grammar, but hey, Rome
wasn't built in a day. I make a lot of
mistakes when I speak, but that's okay.
Rome wasn't built in a day. It's the
kind of phrase you can use to encourage
yourself or even your friends. And since
this is a pronunciation practice moment,
let's break it down and say it one more
time together. This time with natural
rhythm. Rome wasn't built in a day.
Nice. Try saying your den out loud if
you can. Say it to yourself when you
feel frustrated or impatient. It's a
gentle reminder that what you're doing
matters, even if progress feels slow.
Because guess what? Every little bit of
effort you're putting in, it's building
something. One word, one sentence, one
habit at a time.
All right, ready to keep building? Let's
move on to something that will help you
enjoy English even more. Coming up next,
how to make learning feel fun and
exciting so you actually want to keep
going.
So far, we've talked about setting clear
goals, building a simple routine, and
learning to be patient with your
progress. Now, let's talk about
something that can truly change the way
you feel about studying English. And
that is making it fun. Yes, fun. Because
here's a little secret. If you're not
enjoying the process, you won't stick
with it. And I don't just mean having
fun for the sake of entertainment. I
mean creating learning experiences that
feel exciting, meaningful, and personal
to you. Let me ask you, what do you
actually enjoy doing in your free time?
Is it listening to music, watching
movies, playing games, reading stories,
drawing, dancing, talking to people?
Whatever it is, there's a way to connect
that interest to English. For example,
if you love music, try listening to your
favorite songs in English and reading
the lyrics as you sing along. If you
enjoy YouTube, follow English creators
who talk about topics you like: cooking,
fashion, gaming, tech, travel, whatever
makes you smile. If you're into reading,
start with simple English comics,
children's books, or short stories
online. If you like games, change the
language settings to English. Learn new
words as you play. This is what language
experts call contextual learning, when
you learn vocabulary and phrases in
context, doing things you enjoy, not
just memorizing from a list. It's not
only more effective, it's a lot more
fun. In fact, researchers from Cambridge
have found that learners improve faster
when the experience is fun, interesting,
and personally meaningful. That's
because when you're having fun, your
brain is more relaxed, more open to new
information, and more likely to remember
what you learn. Let me share a quick
story. One of my students used to hate
English grammar. She'd freeze every time
we talked about verb tenses, but she
loved cooking. So, we started watching
simple English cooking videos together.
After just a few weeks, she wasn't only
learning new vocabulary like stir, bake,
and slice. She was also hearing grammar
in real situations over and over in a
way that actually made sense to her. And
the best part, she didn't even feel like
she was studying. She was just having
fun doing something she loved in
English. That's the kind of learning I
want for you, too. So, here's my advice.
Stop forcing yourself to study in ways
you hate. Start exploring ways to learn
that actually make you excited. Because
when English becomes part of your life,
not just your lessons, it sticks. You
don't need to study harder. You just
need to study smarter. And that means
doing more of what you love in English.
So, think about it for a second. What's
one activity you already enjoy that you
could start doing in English? Hold that
thought because after the break, I'll
help you review everything we've covered
so far in a nice little recap to keep
everything fresh in your mind.
All right, we've already covered a lot
of helpful tips, so let's take a few
minutes to do a quick recap. This will
help you remember what we've talked
about so far and give you a clear
picture of how to stay motivated as you
continue your English journey. Let's
start at the beginning. First, we talked
about mindset. Remember this. How you
think about your learning affects how
you feel about it. If you're constantly
telling yourself, "I'm bad at this," or,
"I'll never improve," you'll start to
believe it and your motivation will
disappear.
But if you choose to focus on small wins
and remind yourself that progress takes
time, you'll feel stronger and more
confident. So keep this in mind.
Progress is progress no matter how
small. Then we moved on to setting clear
goals. Vague goals like get better at
English don't work. They're too big.
Instead, make your goals small,
specific, and measurable. For example, I
will learn five new words a day. I will
watch one English video every night
before bed. I will practice speaking for
3 minutes each morning. Clear goals give
you direction, and direction gives you
motivation.
Next, we talked about building a
routine. Motivation comes and goes, but
a routine stays. If you can connect
English practice to a regular time in
your day, like after breakfast or before
bed, it becomes automatic. And remember,
your routine doesn't need to be long.
Even 5 or 10 minutes a day is powerful
if you do it consistently.
After that, we took a short break to
learn a motivational English phrase.
Rome wasn't built in a day. It's a great
reminder that big things take time and
learning English is no exception. Say it
to yourself whenever you feel
discouraged. It really helps. And just
now we talked about how to make learning
fun. That means doing things you enjoy
like music, movies, games, or reading in
English. Because when learning feels fun
and personal, it stops feeling like a
chore and starts feeling like something
you want to do. So, if you're feeling a
little overwhelmed, don't worry. You
don't need to do everything at once.
Just pick one of these tips to focus on
this week. Maybe it's writing down a
clear goal. Maybe it's adding 5 minutes
of English to your morning routine. Or
maybe it's switching your favorite game
or show to English for a few days.
Whatever it is, start small. Start
today. And most importantly, don't give
up. You're doing amazing so far, and
we've got more tips coming up, including
how learning with others can boost your
motivation even more. Stick around.
We're just getting to the good stuff.
Now, here's a really powerful tip and
maybe one of the most overlooked. Don't
study alone all the time. Yes, it's
totally fine to study on your own,
especially if that's what fits your
schedule, but when it comes to
motivation, learning with other people,
can make a huge difference.
Why? Because when you're part of
something, even something small like a
conversation or a shared challenge, it
makes you feel more connected, more
encouraged, more human. Learning a
language can feel lonely sometimes,
right? Maybe your friends don't speak
English or your family doesn't
understand why you're practicing so
much. That's okay. But it also means
that finding just one person to share
your progress with can really lift your
energy. Let me give you a few ideas on
how you can study with others, even if
you don't have a classroom or a tutor.
Find a study buddy. This could be a
friend who's also learning English or
even someone who speaks a little better
than you and wants to help. You don't
have to do full lessons together. Just
texting each other in English once a day
can help. Or maybe you video call once a
week and practice speaking. It doesn't
have to be perfect. It just has to be
shared.
Join an online English community. There
are Facebook groups, Telegram channels,
Discord servers, even subreddits full of
people who are learning English just
like you. Many of them are happy to
connect, share tips, or even practice
together through chat or voice messages.
Just search for English learners or
language exchange, and you'll find tons
of groups. Use language exchange apps.
There are apps where you can talk to
native English speakers who want to
learn your language. So, it's a win-win.
You help each other. It might feel scary
at first, but remember, they're
learners, too. Everyone's making
mistakes, and that's part of the
process. Practice with someone in your
house. Even if your family or roommate
doesn't speak English, maybe you can
teach them a word a day or practice
saying hello and goodbye in English. The
more you bring language into your life,
the easier it becomes.
Let me share a little story here. A few
months ago, one of my students was
feeling really stuck. She was learning
vocabulary everyday, but she didn't feel
like it was helping. I asked her, "Are
you using the words in real
conversations?" She said no. She didn't
know anyone to talk to in English. So, I
challenged her to call her cousin who
was also learning and do one minute
voice messages every day. just small
things like, "What did you eat today?
How's the weather? What's one thing you
learned?" You know what happened? Within
a week, she was more motivated than
ever. Not because she was studying
harder, but because she was sharing her
learning. It felt real. So, if you're
feeling low on motivation, maybe what
you need isn't more grammar or more
flashcards. Maybe you just need someone
to share the journey with. Because
learning a language isn't just about the
language. It's about communication. It's
about connection. And you deserve to
feel supported and seen while you learn.
Coming up next, I'll guide you through a
short interactive challenge to help you
take that first social step, even if
it's just a baby one.
Okay, let's do a quick and simple
challenge together. This one is all
about using your English out loud. Even
if it's just for one sentence, even if
you're shy, even if you're completely
alone right now. Why? Because the act of
speaking, of actually using your voice
builds confidence and motivation in a
way that silent study just can't. It
tells your brain, "I'm doing this. I'm
not just learning English. I'm using
it." So, here's what I want you to do
right now or right after this episode
ends. Step one, choose someone to talk
to. It could be a friend who's also
learning English, a family member, a
language partner online, or just
yourself in the mirror. Yes, really.
Step two, say one thing in English out
loud. Just one sentence. That's it. You
can say, "Today I listen to an English
podcast. The weather is sunny. I like
learning English with Emma. Okay, that
last one is just for fun, but I'd be
honored. If you're with someone, say it
to them. If you're alone, say it to
yourself. If you're in public and feel a
little silly, whisper it under your
breath or record a voice message on your
phone. The point is to get the words out
of your head and into the world. And
here's an idea. After you do it, send a
message to someone or even leave a
comment on this podcast episode and
share what you said. Just one sentence.
That's all. Because that one sentence,
that's a spark. And that spark keeps
your motivation alive. And hey, don't
worry about pronunciation. Don't worry
if it's perfect. The goal is to build a
habit of using your English voice
proudly, confidently, and regularly. So,
are you in one sentence, one voice, one
moment of courage? You've got this.
Let's keep going because up next, we're
going to talk about something really
important that most learners forget.
Celebrating your wins, even the tiny
ones.
[Music]
All right, let's talk about something
most learners completely forget to do.
celebrating your wins, even the small
ones. Now, this might sound like a
little thing, but trust me, it's huge
for your motivation. Here's why. When
we're learning something new, especially
something as big and challenging as a
language, it's easy to focus on what we
can't do yet. We think things like, "I
still make mistakes. My accent isn't
good. I didn't understand that whole
video." And guess what? That kind of
thinking slowly kills motivation because
your brain starts to believe you're not
making progress even when you are. But
when you take a moment to recognize even
your smallest success, your brain lights
up, literally. It releases a little dose
of dopamine, the chemical that makes you
feel good. And that feelgood moment
tells your brain, "Hey, I like this.
Let's do it again." That's how habits
form. That's how motivation grows. So,
what does it mean to celebrate a small
win? It can be anything. For example,
you finally understood a sentence in
your favorite English song. That's a
win. You remembered a word you learned
last week. Win. You spoke out loud
today. Even just one sentence. That
counts. You showed up and listened to
this podcast episode all the way to this
point. Major win. And here's the
beautiful part. Your win doesn't have to
be big to matter. In fact, the smaller
the win, the more often you can
celebrate. And the more often you
celebrate, the more excited your brain
gets about learning. So, I want to
encourage you to start a little habit
today. Celebrate every success out loud,
on paper, with a dance, with a snack,
however you like. Maybe keep a small
notebook, your English wins journal, and
every evening just write down one thing
you did in English that day. It could
be, I listened to Emma's podcast. I
wrote one sentence in English. I didn't
give up even when I felt tired. And if
writing is not your thing, just say it
out loud. I did something today. I'm
proud of myself. You could even reward
yourself. Watch your favorite show. Take
a walk. Eat a cookie. Whatever feels
good, link it to your progress because
you deserve to feel good about the work
you're doing. You're showing up. You're
learning. You're growing. And that
deserves to be celebrated. Up next, I'll
show you how to keep track of your
progress in a simple, stress-free way
that helps you stay consistent without
feeling overwhelmed. Let's go. Let's
talk about another powerful way to stay
motivated, and that is tracking your
progress. Now, before you think, uh,
Emma, I'm not organized. I don't like
charts and planners. Don't worry. I'm
not going to ask you to create a
spreadsheet or track every second of
your study time. This is about something
much simpler and much more human. You
see, when you track your progress, even
in a very small way, you create evidence
that you're improving. And that
evidence, it builds confidence. It tells
your brain, look, I am making progress.
I'm not stuck. I'm growing. And when
your brain believes that, your
motivation stays alive. So, here are a
few easy ways to track your English
learning progress, even if you only have
five minutes a day. One, use a calendar
or checklist. Every time you study,
check it off. You don't even need to
write what you did. Just put an X or a V
on the day. After a few days, you'll
start to see a chain and you'll think,
"Wow, look at that. I'm actually doing
this." Two, keep a simple done journal.
Instead of writing what you plan to do,
write what you did do. For example,
Monday, watched one English video.
Tuesday, learned three new words.
Wednesday, practiced speaking out loud
for 2 minutes. That's it. Just one line
per day. It's like a diary of your
success. Three, record your voice
regularly. Even once a week, record
yourself speaking English. You don't
need to post it or share it. Just save
it. After a few weeks, listen back.
You'll be amazed at how your
pronunciation, confidence, and fluency
improve. Four, use habit apps. If you
like digital tools, there's lots of free
habit tracking apps where you can tap a
button every time you complete your
English goal for the day. It becomes
kind of like a game, and it's really
satisfying to see your streak grow.
Here's the key idea. You don't need to
be perfect. You just need to be
consistent. In fact, many language
experts say that short, regular study
sessions are more effective than long,
rare ones. Even just 10 minutes a day is
better than 2 hours once a week because
your brain stays active, alert, and
familiar with the language. So, if
you've been waiting for the perfect time
to study, forget it. There is no perfect
time. There's only today and the small
steps you can take right now. Even
listening to this podcast is progress.
And guess what? You're already doing it.
So, take a deep breath, give yourself
credit, and let's move on to a fun
little vocabulary break just to keep the
energy going. It's time for a little
vocabulary break. But not just any
vocabulary. Today, I want to share a few
uplifting, motivational English words
that you can start using to describe
yourself and your journey as a learner.
These aren't complicated. They're
powerful and they're here to remind you
that you are capable, strong, and moving
forward. Let's go through three words
together. I'll explain them, give you an
example, and then we'll say them out
loud so you can practice. Word one,
persistent. Spelled P E R S I S T N T.
Pronounced persistent.
If someone is persistent, it means they
don't give up. They keep going even when
things are hard. They try again. They
stay committed. Example, she didn't
understand the first time, but she kept
practicing. She's very persistent.
Say it with me. Persistent.
Nice and clear. One more time.
Persistent.
And guess what? If you're still
listening to this podcast, you are
persistent.
Word two, achieve.
spelled a c h i e v e pronounced
achieve.
To achieve something means to succeed at
something you worked hard for. You reach
a goal. Example, he studied English
every day and achieved his goal of
passing the exam. Say it with me.
Achieve.
Again. Achieve.
Now say this out loud right now if you
can. I will achieve my English goals.
Feels good, doesn't it? Word three,
progress. Spelled P R O G R E SS.
Pronounced progress or progress. Both
are correct. Progress is the improvement
you make over time. It's the steps
forward, even if they're small. Example,
she's not fluent yet, but she's making
progress every week. Let's say it
together. Progress
again. Progress. Now, repeat after me.
I'm making progress every day. Yes, you
are. You can write these words on a
sticky note, put them on your mirror, or
say them to yourself whenever you feel
low on motivation. They're small words
with big energy. So remember, you are
persistent. You will achieve your goals
and you are making progress every single
day. Coming up, we'll wrap things up
with a final encouragement and a full
recap of everything we've learned today.
Let's finish strong. Okay, we're almost
at the end of this episode. And if
you've made it this far, I just want to
pause and say you're amazing. Truly,
you've just spent nearly an hour
thinking deeply about your English
journey, how to stay motivated, how to
take care of your mindset, and how to
keep going even on the hard days. That's
no small thing. That shows commitment.
That shows heart. So before we wrap up,
let me give you one last boost of
encouragement and a quick recap of
everything we talked about today. Let's
start with the big idea. Motivation
doesn't come from waiting. It comes from
doing. It grows every time you take
action. Even if that action is small.
Here's what we covered. Mindset matters.
Don't let mistakes control your
confidence. Instead, focus on your small
wins. You're not failing, you're
learning. And learning takes time. Set
clear goals. Don't say, "I want to get
better." Say, "I will learn five new
words today." Or, "I will speak out loud
for 3 minutes." Clear goals create
direction. And direction creates
motivation.
Build a routine. Motivation can be
unreliable, but routines are stable.
Study at the same time every day, even
if it's just for 5 minutes. Tiny habits
done consistently lead to big results.
Learn with joy. Make your learning
personal and fun. Use music, movies,
games, whatever you enjoy. If it feels
fun, you'll want to keep doing it. Study
with others. Find a friend, a community,
or even just talk to yourself. Learning
is more powerful and more motivating
when it's shared. Celebrate small wins.
Recognize your success. Whether it's
understanding a sentence, remembering a
word, or showing up for this podcast, it
all counts.
Track your progress. Keep a journal, use
a checklist, or record your voice.
Seeing your progress, even on paper,
makes it real and rewarding.
Use uplifting language. Words like
persistent, achieve, and progress can
become your inner voice. Start using
them when you talk about yourself and
your goals. And finally, the most
important message I want to leave you
with today. You are not behind. You are
not too slow. You are not too late. You
are right where you need to be. You're
learning. You're trying. And every
little step you take is part of
something bigger. You don't have to be
perfect. You just have to keep going.
Take it one day, one word, one moment at
a time. And remember, Rome wasn't built
in a day. You've got this. And just like
that, we've reached the end of today's
episode. Thank you so much for spending
this time with me. I know you have a
busy life and the fact that you chose to
be here working on your English,
improving your mindset, and staying
motivated means the world. Remember,
learning English isn't just about
textbooks, tests, or perfect grammar.
It's about building confidence. It's
about connecting with others. And most
of all, it's about believing in
yourself, even on the days when progress
feels slow. So, what now? Well, I'd love
for you to take one idea from today,
just one, and use it this week. Maybe
it's writing down a goal. Maybe it's
speaking out loud to yourself for one
minute a day. Maybe it's joining a study
group or simply celebrating your effort
with a little reward. Whatever it is,
take action. even if it's small. That's
how motivation grows. And if this
episode helped you even just a little,
I'd love to hear from you. Leave a
comment, write a review, or message me
on YouTube at Englishphraseshub.
Tell me what your goal is for this week.
Tell me what keeps you motivated. I read
every message, and I'd love to cheer you
on personally. Also, don't forget to
subscribe or follow the podcast so you
don't miss the next episode. We've got
more lessons, phrases, and encouragement
coming your way. All right, that's it
for now. Until next time, stay
consistent, stay kind to yourself, and
stay proud of how far you've come.
You're doing amazing. Talk to you soon,
and keep going. You've got this. Bye for
now.
Good morning, Daniel. Welcome to the
interview. Thank you for coming in
today. How are you? Good morning,
Sophia. I'm doing well, thank you. A
little nervous, to be honest, but I'm
excited to be here. That's completely
normal. Just relax. This is a friendly
conversation. We're happy to get to know
you better. Let's begin with something
simple. Can you tell me a little about
yourself? Sure. My name is Daniel and I
have just over two years of experience
working as a marketing assistant. I
graduated from Brookdale University with
a degree in business communication and
since then I've been working at
Brightwave Media where I've focus mostly
on social media strategy and content
planning. Great. I like that you have
both education and hands-on experience.
So, what would you say are your
strengths? I'd say my biggest strengths
are multitasking, working to deadlines,
and strong communication skills. I'm
also comfortable using tools like Canva,
Google Analytics, and scheduling
software like Buffer and Hootswuite. I
enjoy organizing tasks and staying on
top of timelines even when the schedule
gets tight. That's excellent. Being able
to manage tasks under pressure is
definitely a valuable skill in this
role. Can you give me an example of a
time you successfully handled a project?
Absolutely. In my last position, I
managed a social media campaign for a
new app launch. I worked closely with
the design team to create visual
content, planned a posting schedule, and
adjusted based on analytics. The
campaign lasted 2 weeks and resulted in
a 20% increase in user engagement and a
noticeable boost in downloads. I also
had to coordinate with our ad team and
respond to comments in real time. Very
nice. It sounds like you took initiative
and saw results. Well done. Now, let me
ask, why do you want this job? And why
do you want to join our company? I'm
really passionate about marketing,
especially digital content strategy.
What drew me to your company was your
focus on creative storytelling and your
work with missiondriven brands. I want
to grow as a marketer, learn new tools,
and bring my experience to a team that
values innovation and collaboration.
That's a great answer, and I noticed you
said, "Grow as a marketer and bring my
experience to the team." I like the way
you phrase that. By the way, your resume

expressions are used in real
conversations. We'll also help you
practice with our speaking challenge
near the end. So, stick around to speak
along with us and boost your confidence.
And remember, you don't need to memorize
everything at once. Just listen, enjoy,
and repeat the phrases out loud with us
if you can. You'll be surprised how fast
they stick. So whether you're listening
during your commute, while cooking
dinner, or enjoying a snack, we're glad
you're here. Ready to build your food
vocabulary and sound more like a native
speaker? Let's get things cooking. Our
first dialogue is called morning and
breakfast chat. Let's dive in.
Morning, Daniel. You're already in the
kitchen. It's not even 7. Morning,
Sophie. Yeah, I woke up early and
figured I'd make us something warm.
Thought I'd get a head start on the day.
Aw, that's so nice of you. It already
smells amazing in here. What's cooking?
I'm making some pancakes, scrambled
eggs, and I threw a few sausages on the
skillet. felt like treating ourselves.
Wow, that's a proper breakfast. You're
spoiling us today. I was planning to
just grab a granola bar and run out the
door.
Nah, no skipping breakfast today. They
say it's the most important meal of the
day, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm usually not
a morning person, but if there's coffee
and pancakes involved, I can manage.
Where's the coffee? Just brewed a fresh
pot. Mugs are by the kettle. I even
froth some milk if you want to go fancy.
Barista Daniel add it again. All right,
I'll take a cup with a splash of milk.
No sugar. Coming right up. By the way, I
picked up some fresh berries yesterday.
We can throw them on the pancakes with a
drizzle of honey. M. Do we have any
juice? Yep, there's orange juice in the
fridge. Not from concentrate this time.
I splurged. Living large. I'm impressed.
You really went all out today. Well, I
figured we could both use a good start.
We've got a busy day ahead. Meetings,
deadlines, emails. Don't remind me. If I
don't eat, I'll be completely useless by
noon and probably hangry.
Yeah, I've seen hangry, Sophie. It's a
little scary.
I warned you. Okay, I'll grab plates and
cutlery. Let's make it feel like a real
breakfast. Awesome. Food will be ready
in a jiffy. Go ahead and put on some
music if you want. Let's enjoy this
before the chaos begins. Sounds good.
Thanks again for cooking, Daniel. You're
a lifesaver. Anytime. Now, sit back, sip
your coffee, and let Chef Daniel do his
thing.
That was such a cozy and relatable
scene, wasn't it? I love mornings like
that. Relaxed, full of good smells, and
great English phrases.
Same here. And there's a lot to learn in
that short conversation. So, let's break
it down phrase by phrase to help you
understand everything clearly. Great.
Let's start with something Daniel said
early on. I thought I'd whip up some
breakfast. To whip something up means to
cook something quickly and without too
much effort. It's informal and super
common in casual conversation.
That's right. And then Sophie said,
"Wow, that's a proper breakfast." A
proper breakfast means a full satisfying
meal, not just a quick snack. It usually
includes several items like eggs, toast,
fruit, or pancakes. She also mentioned
she was going to just grab a granola bar
and run out the door. The phrase grab a
granola bar or grab a bite means to eat
something quick and easy. It's perfect
when you're in a rush. And here's one of
my favorite phrases, caffeine fix. When
Sophie said, "I need my caffeine fix,"
she meant she really needed coffee to
wake up and function. A fix is slang for
something you rely on regularly, like
caffeine or sugar. Yes. And don't forget
the phrase, "I splurged." Daniel used it
when he talked about buying better
orange juice. To splurge means to spend
more money than usual on something nice
or luxurious. It's often a treat.
Another good one was hangry. That's a
blend of hungry and angry. If someone
hasn't eaten and starts to get grumpy or
irritable, we say they're hangry.
I've definitely been hangry before,
Jake. Not my best moments. Same here.
And then Daniel said, "Breakfast will be
ready in a jify." That's an old but fun
expression. In a jiffy just means very
soon or in a short time. Sophie also
said, "I'll grab plates and cutlery,"
which is another way of saying she'll
help prepare the table. Cutlery refers
to forks, knives, and spoons. In the US,
people also call it silverware. Good
point. And don't miss the phrase, "Let's
make it feel like a real breakfast."
That's a nice way to describe making a
meal more enjoyable, setting the table,
slowing down, and sharing it together.
This whole dialogue gave us a mix of
everyday food vocabulary and warm
expressions used in the kitchen or
during breakfast. So, here's a quick
review of some key terms. Whip up. Cook
quickly and easily. Proper breakfast. A
full satisfying meal. Grab a bite. Eat
something quickly. Caffeine fix. Your
regular dose of coffee.
Splurge. Spend more than usual on
something nice. Hungry. Hungry plus
angry. In a jiffy very soon. And
cutlery. Knives. forks and spoons. If
any of those are new to you, don't
worry. Just listen again and try saying
the phrases out loud. Practice makes
perfect. Up next, we're heading out of
the kitchen and into a local cafe. Get
ready for dialogue 2, ordering at a
cafe. And don't forget to grab your
coffee.
Yes, stay with us. The next conversation
is full of practical expressions for
ordering food and drinks. Let's go.
Good morning. Welcome to the morning
mug. What can I get started for you?
Hey, good morning. Um, I think I'll go
with a cappuccino. Medium size, please.
Great choice. Would you like whole milk,
oat milk, or almond milk? Oat milk,
please. And can I get an extra shot of
espresso? I need a bit of a boost today.
Absolutely. One strong oat milk
cappuccino coming up. Hot, right? Yes,
hot. I'm freezing this morning. You and
everyone else. Anything to eat with
that? Hm. What do you recommend? Well,
our cinnamon rolls are fresh out of the
oven. We've also got scones, chocolate
chip muffins, and ham and cheese
croissants. Wow, that sounds tempting.
I'll take a cinnamon roll, please.
Warmed up if possible. Definitely. I'll
heat it for a few seconds so it's soft
and gooey. Yum. That sounds amazing.
So, that's one medium oat milk
cappuccino with an extra shot and one
warm cinnamon roll. Anything else?
That's it for now. Oh, can I get that
for takeaway? For sure. I'll pack it all
up. That comes to $9.25.
Here's my card. Do you take Apple Pay?
Yep, we do. Just tap here. Perfect.
You're all set. Do you need a receipt?
No, I'm good, thanks. I just need
caffeine and sugar.
You're in the right place. Your order
will be ready at the pickup counter in
just a few minutes. Awesome. Thanks so
much. You've been super helpful.
Anytime.
Have a great morning, Sophie. You, too.
That was such a real life moment, wasn't
it? I mean, who hasn't had a sleepy
morning and needed a strong coffee and
something sweet?
Yeah, I think I've been Sophie at least
twice this week. There's so much great
everyday English in that dialogue. Let's
go through it together. Let's start with
the basics. Sophie said, "I'll go with a
cappuccino." That's a great way to order
politely. You can say I'll go with or
I'll have when ordering food or drinks.
And then Daniel asked about milk
options. Would you like whole milk, oat
milk, or almond milk? That's a really
typical question in coffee shops these
days, especially with all the milk
alternatives. You can answer with oat
milk, please. Next, Sophie said, "Can I
get an extra shot of espresso?" The
phrase extra shot means you want more
caffeine, usually for a stronger drink.
Baristas will know what you mean right
away. She also said, "I need a bit of a
boost today." That's a casual way to say
you need energy. You'll hear, "I need a
caffeine boost or a sugar boost a lot."
Great catch. And then came a key food
question. What do you recommend? That's
perfect for cafes or restaurants. Use it
when you're not sure what to order. It
shows you trust the staff's opinion.
Daniel described the cinnamon rolls as
fresh out of the oven. That phrase means
they were just baked. You can say it
about cookies, bread, or anything hot
and fresh. Then Sophie asked, "Warmed up
if possible." Very polite. You can also
say, "Could you warm it up?" Or, "Can I
have it heated, please?"
And of course, she said, "Can I get that
for takeaway?" In American English, you
might also hear to go. In British
English, it's usually takeaway. Another
great one is, "Do you take Apple Pay?"
That's important if you're not using
cash. You can also ask, "Do you accept
cards?" or "Can I tap?" Sophie finished
with, "You've been super helpful," which
is a lovely way to say thank you
sincerely. So true. Let's do a quick
recap of some of the best phrases from
this dialogue. I'll go with or I'll have
polite ways to order. Oat milk, almond
milk, or whole milk. Milk options. Extra
shot of espresso for stronger coffee. I
need a boost. I need more energy. What
do you recommend? Asking for a
suggestion. Fresh out of the oven. Just
baked. Warm it up. Heat food slightly.
Takeaway UK or to go US food to take
with you. Do you take Apple Pay? Payment
method. You've been super helpful.
Friendly way to show gratitude. So true.
So if you're ever in a cafe and want to
sound natural, try using a few of these
phrases. Absolutely. Even practicing in
front of the mirror helps. Or next time
you're ordering your favorite drink,
throw in one new phrase. And speaking of
food, don't go anywhere. Up next, we're
headed into the kitchen for dialogue 3,
cooking together. It's going to be
delicious.
See you there.
All right, Chef Sophie, what's the plan
for tonight's masterpiece?
We're making creamy garlic mushroom
pasta with a little twist. I'm throwing
in some spinach and sundried tomatoes.
Ooh, fancy. You had me at creamy. Where
do we begin? First things first, boil
water in that big pot. Don't forget to
add a generous pinch of salt. It's the
secret to flavorful pasta. Right. Salty
water, like the ocean, but delicious.
Water's on the boil. Great. While that
heats up, can you wash and slice these
mushrooms? About medium thin. I'll mince
the garlic and dice the onions. On it, I
feel like I'm on a cooking show today on
Daniel's Kitchen.
Careful. The audience is watching and
they don't like soggy mushrooms. Got it.
Mushrooms looking sharp. What's next?
Heat up a splash of olive oil in that
large skillet, medium heat. Then toss in
the onions and garlic. Let them sauté
until they're soft and golden. Sauté.
That's chef speak for cook while
stirring so you don't burn it. Right.
Basically, yes. Just keep things moving
in the pan. It brings out the flavor.
Okay. Onions are sizzling and the garlic
smells amazing. Time to add the
mushrooms. Yes. Go ahead. Stir them in
and let them cook down. They'll shrink
and get nice and brown. These mushrooms
are soaking up the flavor. Should we
season them? Good thinking. Add a pinch
of salt and pepper. Maybe some dried
thyme, too. Oh, and a splash of white
wine if you're feeling fancy. We're
going gourmet. Just a splash. There we
go. Chef Sophie, are we simmering now?
Yep. Let everything simmer while we
check the pasta.
Check the pot. It's al dente. Firm, but
not hard. Perfect. Drain it. Then toss
it back in the pot. Now, pour that
creamy mushroom mixture over the pasta
and stir it all together. This smells
like a five-star restaurant. Can I add
cheese? Yes. Sprinkle some parmesan on
top and garnish with fresh basil if
you're feeling extra fancy. Done.
Sophie, this looks incredible. We could
seriously open a beastro. Let's not get
ahead of ourselves. First, we eat, then
we dream. Deal. And maybe take a food
pic for Instagram. Obviously, no one
eats until the photo is perfect.
[Music]
I love this one. It's so cozy and full
of real, practical vocabulary. Cooking
with a friend is not only fun, but a
great way to learn natural English.
Totally. And Sophie and Daniel used a
ton of phrases and expressions you'll
hear in any kitchen. Let's walk through
the key language. First, Sophie said,
"What's on the menu tonight?" This is a
great casual question when you're asking
what someone plans to cook or eat. Then,
we heard boil water and add a pinch of
salt. A pinch just means a small amount.
often used in cooking when you don't
need to measure. When Daniel was slicing
mushrooms, Sophie told him to be careful
with the knife. Good advice. And we also
heard the phrase mushroom duty. That's a
casual way of saying you're in charge of
something. In this case, slicing
mushrooms. And Sophie teased him with
don't burn the kitchen down. That's a
humorous exaggeration. Obviously, we
hope that never happens. Another great
word, sauté. That's pronounced sauté. It
means to cook food quickly in a small
amount of oil over medium heat. And
Daniel asked, "We're simmering now." To
simmer means to cook something gently,
not boiling, just small bubbles. It's
great for sauces. He also said the pasta
was al dente. That's an Italian phrase
meaning the pasta is cooked but still
firm, not too soft. They used words like
sprinkle and garnish. To sprinkle is to
scatter something lightly like cheese.
To garnish means adding something on top
to make it look nice, like basil or
herbs. And when they said, "Let's toss
the pasta with the sauce." The verb toss
means to mix it gently, usually with a
spoon or tongs. Plus, I loved how they
joked about opening a beastro and how no
one eats before the perfect food pick.
That's real life. And this dialogue gave
you vocabulary for actions, ingredients,
and even a little humor around cooking.
Let's walk through a quick recap for the
main vocabulary and expressions you
heard in that dialogue. I'll start us
off. What's on the menu? That's a casual
way to ask, "What are we eating or
cooking today?" Next is pinch of salt.
That means a small amount of salt just
using your fingers. Then we had mushroom
duty. a playful way of saying you're in
charge of slicing mushrooms. You can use
this with any task. And sauté. This
means to cook something quickly in a
small amount of oil over medium heat.
It's pronounced sauté.
We also heard simmer. That means cooking
something gently on low heat. Not
boiling, just small bubbles. It's great
for sauces. And don't forget all dente.
That's how pasta should be cooked. firm
to the bite, not mushy. It's an Italian
term. Then there's sprinkle. That means
to lightly scatter something like cheese
or herbs on top of your food. And
finally, garnish. This is when you
decorate your dish with something fresh
like basil or lemon slices to make it
look good. Oh, one more. Toss with
sauce. That means mixing the cooked
pasta and the sauce gently together
until it's well combined. These words
are used in kitchens all over the world,
especially in English-speaking
countries, so they're worth remembering.
Yes. And if you're learning English, try
saying them out loud while you cook, or
even pretend you're hosting your own
cooking show. That actually works.
Practice makes perfect and delicious
pasta. Coming up next, Dialogue 4, a
trip to a restaurant. You'll learn how
to order food, respond politely, and
even deal with small issues at the
table. Stay tuned and bring your
appetite.
Good evening. Welcome to Bellaroma.
Table for two. Yes, please. We have a
reservation under Sophie. Great. Right
this way. Here are your menus.
Would you like to start with something
to drink? I'll have sparkling water,
please. I'll take a lemonade. Thank you.
Perfect. I'll be right back with your
drinks. I'm torn between the lasagna and
the seafood pasta. Everything looks
amazing. I think I'll go with the
grilled salmon. Light but filling. Here
are your drinks. Are you ready to order?
Yes. I'll have the grilled salmon with
roasted vegetables, please.
And I'll take the lasagna. Excellent
choices. Anything else to start? Perhaps
an appetizer. H how about bruschetta for
the table? Great idea.
One order of bruschetta coming up. How's
everything tasting? It's delicious.
Thank you. Really good. Compliments to
the chef. I'll let the kitchen know.
Would you like to see the dessert menu?
Oh, I'm tempted. What do you recommend?
The tirammy sue is our specialty.
Creamy, rich, and homemade. Say no more.
We'll share one.
You read my mind. Can I get you anything
else? Just the check, please.
Absolutely. I'll bring it right over.
That was such a nice meal. Agreed. We
should make this a regular thing.
That felt just like a real dinner out,
didn't it? The way Sophie and Daniel
spoke was so natural, exactly how people
chat when they're dining at a restaurant
in English. Totally. They navigated the
whole meal like pros, from ordering
drinks to giving compliments to the
chef. Let's break down some of the key
phrases and useful vocabulary they used
during the conversation.
I'll kick us off again. Table for two.
That's a very common greeting from the
host or server when you arrive at a
restaurant. Then Sophie said, "We have a
reservation under Sophie." That means
the table was booked ahead of time using
her name. Right. Then the server asked,
"Would you like to start with something
to drink?" That's standard. It just
means, "Can I get you a drink while you
look at the menu?" Daniel and Sophie
replied with drink orders, sparkling
water and lemonade. Great choices and
simple to say. Next up, the phrase, "I'm
torn between." Daniel said, "I'm torn
between the lasagna and seafood pasta."
That means he couldn't decide. Both
options sounded good. Yeah, I say that
all the time when I see pizza on any
menu.
Classic. Then Sophie said, "The salmon
was light but filling." That's a good
phrase to describe food that's not too
heavy, but still satisfying. The server
also said, "Anything else to start?
Perhaps an appetizer." An appetizer is a
small dish before the main meal. In this
case, bruschetta.
M I love bruschetta. And later we heard
the phrase compliments to the chef.
That's a nice way to say the food was
amazing. Usually said to your server.
Then the server offered dessert and
suggested tiramisu, which he described
as creamy, rich, and homemade. Great
descriptive words for desserts.
And when Sophie said, "You read my
mind." That means Daniel guessed exactly
what she was thinking. It's a fun,
friendly phrase. Finally, when they were
ready to leave, Daniel asked for the
check, which is what you say in the US.
In the UK, you might hear the bill. This
kind of vocabulary is super useful for
real life situations, whether you're
traveling, on a date, or just grabbing
dinner with friends.
Definitely. You can even practice by
pretending you're ordering food. Make a
game out of it. Coming up next, a quick
speaking challenge where you can try out
some of today's phrases out loud. Don't
go anywhere. The challenge is next.
Okay, it's time for our speaking
challenge. Your turn to practice. That's
right. We want you to speak out loud.
Yes, actually say these phrases and get
comfortable using them in real life. So,
here's your challenge. Imagine you're at
a restaurant. Try saying these three
sentences clearly and confidently. Hi,
we have a reservation under your name.
I'm torn between the steak and the
pasta. Could we see the dessert menu,
please? Bonus challenge. Try using a new
phrase from today's episode in your own
madeup sentence. For example, this salad
is light but filling or compliments to
the chef. The food was amazing. And if
you really want to level up, record
yourself saying them or even roleplay
with a friend or study partner. And hey,
if you're feeling brave, share your
sentence in the comments or send us a
message. We'd love to hear how you're
using these phrases.
Keep practicing and your confidence will
grow with every episode.
Now, it's time for one of our favorite
parts of the episode, listener Q&A.
Today's question comes from Louise in
Brazil, and it's a great one. Louise
asks, "What's the difference between
cook, chef, and home cook? Can I use
them the same way? Love that question,
Louis. It's super useful.
Let's break it down. So, the word cook
can be both a verb and a noun. As a
verb, it means to prepare food. Example,
I love to cook Italian food. As a noun,
cook can also refer to a person who
prepares meals, especially in casual or
non-professional settings. For example,
she's a great cook.
Now, chef is more specific. A chef is a
professional cook, usually someone who
has studied culinary arts or works in a
restaurant kitchen. You'd say, "He's a
pastry chef at a five-star hotel." And
then we have home cook. That's someone
who cooks at home, not professionally,
like your mom, your uncle, or even you
if you like experimenting in the
kitchen. For example, she's just a home
cook, but her lasagna is amazing.
So, to recap, cook can be general. Chef
means a trained pro. A home cook means
someone who cooks for fun or family.
Great question, Louis. And if you're
listening and have a question, too, send
it in. We might feature it in a future
episode. Whether it's about food,
idioms, or tricky grammar, we love
hearing from you. Keep those questions
coming. Ready for our final recap? Let's
go.
Before we wrap up this delicious
episode, let's do a final recap of the
vocabulary phrases and idioms you heard
today, all centered around food,
cooking, and eating out. Yep. Whether
you're preparing a meal or ordering at a
restaurant, these expressions will help
you sound more natural and confident in
English. Okay, here we go. Repeat after
us if you'd like or just listen and soak
it all in.
Reservation. That means booking a table
in advance. For example, we have a
reservation under Emma.
Appetizer.
A small dish served before the main
course like soup, salad, or bruschetta.
I'm torn between. This means you're
unsure or having a hard time choosing
between two things. For example, I'm
torn between the lasagna and the seafood
pasta.
Light but filling. A phrase to describe
food that isn't too heavy but still
satisfies your hunger.
Compliments to the chef. This is a
polite and classy way to say the food
was excellent. You usually say it to
your server.
Desert menu. A menu that shows sweet
treats you can order after your main
dish.
The check or the bill. That's what you
ask for when you're ready to pay. In the
US, we say the check. In the UK, it's
the bill.
You read my mind. A fun and friendly way
to say someone guessed exactly what you
were thinking.
Sparkling water.
A fizzy water choice often offered in
restaurants, especially if you don't
want soda or juice.
Let's move into some basic cooking terms
you might have heard in the dialogues.
Grill
to cook food over direct heat, usually
on a barbecue or grill pan.
Roast to cook food in the oven using dry
heat, like roasted chicken or potatoes.
Sauté.
To cook food quickly in a small amount
of oil over mediumigh heat.
Simmer. To cook something gently, just
below boiling, like simmering a sauce or
soup.
And now for a few fun idioms and
expressions we used or mentioned
earlier.
Too many cooks spoil the broth. That
means if too many people are involved in
something, it might not go well.
Spill the beans. A casual way to say
reveal a secret.
A recipe for disaster. An expression to
describe a situation that's very likely
to go wrong.
That's a whole menu of English phrases
today, from everyday vocabulary to
colorful idioms.
And don't worry if you didn't catch
everything, you can always go back and
listen again.
And the best way to make these words
stick is practice using them. Try
talking about your last restaurant
experience. describe your favorite meal
or even act out one of today's dialogues
with a friend.
And that brings us to the end of this
tasty episode of the English phrases Hub
podcast.

this episode is for you. Ready to level
up your business English? Let's do it.
Let's go.
First, let's warm up with some really
useful business English words and
phrases. Jake, have you ever heard the
phrase deadline? M yes, I've heard it in
meetings and emails, but I'm never 100%
sure I use it correctly. What exactly is
a deadline? Good question. A deadline is
the final time or date by which
something must be completed. It's like a
due date but for work. For example, our
project deadline is Friday at 5:00 p.m.
Which means it has to be finished before
then. Ah, so if I say I'll get it done
before the deadline, that sounds
professional. Yes, totally natural. And
you'll hear it all the time in the
office, especially in emails. Just a
reminder, the deadline is approaching.
Got it. So, deadlines equal important.
Exactly. Now, here's another one. Follow
up. What do you think that means? H
is it like check-in later? That's right.
If you say, "I'll follow up with you
next week." It means you'll contact that
person again. Maybe to give an update or
ask for feedback, it's a very polite way
to stay in touch without sounding pushy.
Oh, like when someone says, "Thanks for
the update. I'll follow up after the
meeting." Perfect example. Okay. What
about agenda and presentation?
Those sound um formal.
They do, but we use them all the time in
business. An agenda is just the list of
topics for a meeting. You might hear,
"Let's stick to the agenda," or, "I've
added your item to the agenda." So, it's
basically the meeting plan. Exactly. And
a presentation is when you speak to a
group, usually with slides, about a
specific topic. For example, I'm giving
a presentation on sales strategy
tomorrow. Wow, I've heard that one a
lot, but never quite felt confident
saying it. Now I will. Great. And don't
forget your basics. Meeting, email,
phone call. You'll say those all the
time. Yeah. And probably with phrases
like, "Let's schedule a meeting or I'll
send a follow-up email." Right. Exactly.
Right. See, you're on a roll. One more
thing. In meetings, sometimes I hear
phrases I don't understand. What should
I do? Great question. One simple trick,
listen carefully to what your co-workers
say, especially repeated phrases. Then
jot them down in a notebook or app.
Later, look them up or even ask someone
you trust. So, I'm basically building my
own business vocabulary list. Yes. And
over time, you'll sound more natural
without even thinking about it. And hey,
if you're working remotely, you can also
learn from watching English YouTube
channels, business themed shows, or
listening to business podcasts. Exposure
makes a big difference. So, keep my ears
open and don't be afraid to learn in the
wild. Exactly. English is everywhere.
You just have to be curious and
consistent. Got it. And coming up next
is Jake's mistake.
Yep. one of your classic oops moments in
the office. But don't worry, we'll learn
from it together. I hope it's not the
coffee spill incident. You'll have to
wait and see. Stay tuned. It's coming
right up.
Hey, Emma. Quick question. Do you
remember our project deadline? I wrote
it down somewhere. I think it's at
Monday, right?
Oh, Jake, so close. But nope. In
English, we don't say at Monday. We say
on Monday. Ah, I always mess that one
up. So, it's on Monday. Got it? Yep. We
use on for days of the week. So, you'd
say, "Our project deadline is on
Monday." Or even shorter, the deadline
is Monday. Both sound natural. Okay,
cool. Not at Monday, not in Monday, not
around Monday, just on Monday. English
prepositions are wild.
You're getting it. Oh, and since we're
talking about deadlines, here's a useful
business phrase. We often say, "I'm good
at working to deadlines." Wait, working
to deadlines? Yep. Like in a job
interview, you could say, "I'm good at
meeting deadlines." Or, "I work well
under pressure and can meet tight
deadlines."
I'll say, "I'm excellent at panicking 10
minutes before the deadline. Does that
count?" Only if you still hit the
deadline. But yes, using phrases like
meeting deadlines or working to
deadlines makes you sound professional
and reliable. Got it. So, next time I'll
say the deadline is on Monday and I'm
good at working to deadlines. How's
that? Perfect. And no more at Monday.
Your grammar is safe for now. Thanks,
Emma. And to all our listeners, don't
worry if you make little mistakes like
that. We all do. The important thing is
to learn, keep practicing, and have a
sense of humor about it. Exactly. And
now that you've got a few phrases in
your toolkit, it's time to hear them in
action. Up next is a short dialogue all
about a job interview. Listen closely to
how the vocabulary is used naturally and
then we'll come back right after to
break it all down together. So don't go
anywhere. The job interview dialogue is
coming up right now.
Good morning, Daniel. Welcome to the
interview. Thank you for coming in
today. How are you? Good morning,
Sophia. I'm doing well, thank you. A
little nervous to be honest, but I'm
excited to be here. That's completely
normal. Just relax. This is a friendly
conversation. We're happy to get to know
you better. Let's begin with something
simple. Can you tell me a little about
yourself? Sure. My name is Daniel and I
have just over 2 years of experience
working as a marketing assistant. I
graduated from Brookdale University with
a degree in business communication. And
since then, I've been working at
Brightwave Media, where I focus mostly
on social media strategy and content
planning. Great. I like that you have
both education and hands-on experience.
So, what would you say are your
strengths? I'd say my biggest strengths
are multitasking, working to deadlines,
and strong communication skills. I'm
also comfortable using tools like Canva,
Google Analytics, and scheduling
software like Buffer and Hootsweet. I
enjoy organizing tasks and staying on
top of timelines even when the schedule
gets tight. That's excellent. Being able
to manage tasks under pressure is
definitely a valuable skill in this
role. Can you give me an example of a
time you successfully handled a project?
Absolutely. In my last position, I
managed a social media campaign for a
new app launch. I worked closely with
the design team to create visual
content, planned a posting schedule, and
adjusted based on analytics. The
campaign lasted two weeks and resulted
in a 20% increase in user engagement and
a noticeable boost in downloads. I also
had to coordinate with our ad team and
respond to comments in real time. Very
nice. It sounds like you took initiative
and saw results. Well done. Now, let me
ask, why do you want this job? and why
do you want to join our company? I'm
really passionate about marketing,
especially digital content strategy.
What drew me to your company was your
focus on creative storytelling and your
work with missiondriven brands. I want
to grow as a marketer, learn new tools,
and bring my experience to a team that
values innovation and collaboration.
That's a great answer. And I noticed you
said grow as a marketer and bring my
experience to the team. I like the way
you phrase that. By the way, your resume
shows solid experience and I appreciate
how you explain your skills clearly.
Thank you. I've been practicing how to
talk about my experience in English, so
I'm glad it's coming across well. It
definitely is. Last quick question. How
you feel about working in a team and
handling feedback? I really enjoy
working in teams. In fact, most of the
campaigns I've worked on have been
collaborative. I also appreciate
feedback, positive or constructive,
because it helps me improve. I always
try to listen, learn, and adjust
quickly. That's great to hear. Well,
Daniel, thank you for your time today.
It's been a pleasure speaking with you.
Thank you, Sophia. I really appreciate
the opportunity to speak with you. I
look forward to hearing from you soon.
We'll be in touch shortly. Have a great
rest of your day.
Welcome back. How was that job interview
dialogue? I loved it. Daniel handled it
like a pro, even when he got a little
nervous. And Sophia was such a calm and
friendly interviewer. Yep. And there
were some great phrases and vocabulary
in there that you'll definitely want to
remember, especially if you're preparing
for a job interview in English. Let's go
through a few of them. First up, the
classic opening. Tell me a little about
yourself. That's a super common question
in interviews. It's your chance to give
a short, confident summary of your
background, education, and experience.
Exactly. A great answer might include
where you studied, where you worked, and
what kind of role you're looking for.
Keep it clear and relevant to the job.
Next up, the word strengths. Sophia
asked, "What are your strengths?" That
means, "What are you good at?" And
Daniel answered with some excellent
ones. multitasking,
working to deadlines, organizing tasks,
communicating clearly. All of those are
great to mention in a job interview.
They show that you're responsible and
reliable. Another phrase that stood out
was fast-paced environment. Yes, that's
a common way to describe a workplace
that's busy or where things change
quickly, like marketing, customer
service, or tech. Saying you've worked
in a fast-paced environment shows you
can keep up and adapt. Sophia also asked
Daniel why he wanted the job. And he
said, "I want to grow as a marketer. I
want to bring my experience to your
team." That's a really nice language. It
shows motivation and a team mindset. And
he also said the company's mission
inspired him. That's always a strong
answer. It means you care about the
values or purpose of the company. Oh,
and don't forget collaborative and
feedback. Daniel said he enjoys working
in teams and appreciates constructive
feedback, right? That shows he's not
only skilled but open to learning and
improving, which every employer loves.
Okay, let's do a quick list of key words
and phrases from the interview. First,
tell me a little about yourself. That's
a standard opening question to introduce
your background. Strengths means the
things you're good at, your best work
skills. Multitasking is doing several
tasks at once, like juggling emails and
meetings. Working to deadlines means
finishing work on time, meeting due
dates. A fast-paced environment is a
busy, constantly changing workplace.
Collaborative or team player means
someone who works well with others.
Feedback or constructive feedback means
helpful advice to improve your
performance. And why do you want this
job asks about your motivation and
interest in the role? Mission and values
are the company's purpose and beliefs.
And grow as a role means you want to
improve and develop professionally.
great phrases to remember for your next
job interview. So, if you're preparing
for an interview, try practicing your
answers using some of these expressions.
Even short, simple sentences can sound
professional when you use the right
vocabulary. And if you make a small
mistake like Daniel did, don't panic.
Just take a breath, correct yourself
politely, and keep going. That shows
confidence, too. Exactly. Remember,
interviewers aren't looking for perfect
English. They're looking for someone who
communicates clearly and honestly. All
right. Now that we've handled the
interview, let's move on to another
common business situation, the team
meeting. In our next dialogue, you'll
hear how people speak during a work
meeting. How they make suggestions, ask
for updates, and stay polite and
professional. So listen carefully for
the phrases that will be used during
this meeting. Ready to go? Let's jump
into dialogue 2, the meeting. We'll be
back right after to break it all down
for you.
Good morning everyone. Thanks for being
here. We've got quite a bit on today's
agenda, so let's jump right in. Morning
Liam. Ready to go. Good morning
everyone. First, let's talk about our
project deadline. The final report is
due on Friday. Is everyone on track to
finish their sections? Yes, Friday works
for me. I've drafted most of the content
already. Same here. I just need to
double check some figures, but I should
be done by Thursday. Great. Thanks both.
Next item. Carlos, could you give us a
quick update on the data analysis? Sure.
We've completed the initial data run and
I've created some charts for the key
metrics. I sent them to the group this
morning. Once I get your feedback, I'll
polish the visuals and drop them into
the final report. Sounds good. I'll
review those this afternoon. Now, Nina,
how's the design side coming along?
We've completed the homepage mockups and
I've sent them out for review. I'm
expecting feedback by tomorrow. Once
that's in, I'll follow up with the
developers to start implementation.
Perfect. It sounds like we're on track.
Any questions so far? I actually have
one more thing to add. For next week's
client meeting, should we prepare a
short presentation summary? Yes, let's
plan on that. A quick 5-minute
presentation sounds good. Each of us can
take one part. I'll cover the design
progress and visuals. I can walk through
the numbers and charts. And I'll start
with a brief summary of our key
findings. That way, we keep it simple
and organized. Great. I'll draft a few
slides this week and share them with you
both. Same here. I'll clean up the
charts and send you the final versions
by Wednesday. Awesome. Thanks, team.
That covers everything on today's
agenda. Shall I take meeting minutes
again? If you don't mind, that would be
great. and let's aim to send them out by
the end of the day. Thanks, Nina.
And we're back. That was a great team
meeting. Did you catch all the useful
business phrases? Yeah, Liam did a great
job leading the meeting and Nina and
Carlos had some strong updates. Now,
let's break down a few phrases you
probably heard and might want to use at
work. First up, agenda. That means the
list of topics to be discussed in a
meeting. For example, we've got a lot on
today's agenda. Then we had deadline. A
deadline is the final date something
must be completed. Example, the report
is due on Friday. Another common one,
update. To give an update means to share
the current progress or status of a
task. Example, can you give us an update
on the design? And Nah said she would
follow up with the developer. Follow up
with means to check in or contact
someone again about something. Just
remember, it's follow up with, not
follow up on. Great catch. We also heard
feedback. That means comments or
opinions to help improve work. Example,
I'm expecting feedback by tomorrow.
There was also mockup. A mockup is a
sample or rough version of a design
before it's finalized. Example, we
finished the homepage mock-ups. Toward
the end, they talked about a
presentation summary. That's a short
version of a longer presentation just
covering the key points. And finally,
meeting minutes. These are notes from
the meeting, a written summary of what
was discussed and decided. So, if you're
joining meetings in English, try using
some of these phrases. They'll help you
sound professional and confident. And
remember, even asking simple questions
like, "Can you clarify that?" shows
great communication skills. Absolutely.
Up next, we'll dive into dialogue three,
a conversation about a business phone
call and writing a professional email.
And stay with us. We'll be right back
after this next conversation.
Hello. Hello. Is this Mr. Turner
speaking? May I ask who's calling? This
is Rachel Adams from Metro Solutions. We
spoke last week regarding your website
redesign project. Oh, yes, of course.
Hi, Rachel. How are you? I'm doing well,
thank you. And I hope you're doing well,
too. I'm good. Thanks for asking. I'm
just calling to follow up on the invoice
we sent over on Monday. I wanted to make
sure you received it and check if
everything looks okay. Yes, I did
receive the invoice. Thank you for
checking in. I have it right here in
front of me. Great to hear. I just
wanted to make sure there were no
issues. No, everything looks correct.
The details match the proposal we
discussed and the payment amount is
clear. I'll go ahead and process payment
by Friday. Perfect. Thank you so much
for confirming, Mr. Turner. I really
appreciate it. No problem at all. Thank
you for staying on top of it. I'll also
send you a short follow-up email
tomorrow just as a gentle reminder. Let
me know if you need anything in the
meantime. That sounds good. Thanks
again, Rachel. You're very welcome. Have
a great day, Mr. Turner. You too.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
All right, time to send that follow-up
email. After a client call, it's always
a good idea to put things in writing. It
keeps everything clear and professional.
Let's start with the subject line. H
I'll keep it simple and relevant.
Follow up on invoice
Metro Solutions.
Yep, that works. It tells the client
exactly what the email is about and
reminds them who it's from. Okay, now
for the greeting.
Dear Mr. Turner. Polite and formal.
Always good to use the client's name.
Now, the opening line. I'll start with a
quick thank you.
Thank you for your time on the phone
today. That sounds warm and respectful.
Next, I want to remind him what this
email is about without repeating too
much.
I'm writing to follow up and confirm
that you received the invoice we sent
earlier this week. That's clear and
professional. It shows I'm just checking
in, not pushing or rushing.
H maybe I should leave the door open for
questions, too.
Please let me know if you have any
questions or need further clarification.
Perfect. It shows I'm open and willing
to help. And let's end on a positive
note. I truly appreciate your support
and look forward to working together on
your project. That keeps the
relationship warm and friendly.
Now, I'll just sign off with best
regards, Rachel Adams, client relations,
Metro Solutions.
Done. Short, polite, and to the point.
That's how I like my follow-up emails.
Clear, professional, and easy to respond
to.
And that was our third dialogue, a
professional phone call with a client
followed by a polite email. This kind of
communication happens a lot in the
business world, and it's so important to
feel confident when doing it in English.
Definitely, Rachel did a great job on
that call. Clear, polite, and
professional. Let's take a minute to go
over some of the key phrases you heard.
First, the client said, "May I ask who's
calling?" That's a very polite way to
ask who's on the other end of the phone.
You'll hear this all the time in
business calls. And Rachel replied with,
"I'm calling to follow up about." That's
a super useful phrase. It means you're
checking in about something like an
invoice, a meeting, or a project update.
You can also say things like, "Just
following up to confirm," or, "I wanted
to check if you received," these sound
professional, but still friendly. The
client, Mr. Turner, also said, "I'll
process the payment by Friday." That's a
formal way to say, "I'll make the
payment." It's clear and polite, perfect
for work situations.
After the call, Rachel wrote a follow-up
email, and that's where we saw even more
helpful phrases. Let's break down a few.
Thank you for your time on the phone
today. A polite, professional way to
open. I'm writing to follow up and
confirm. Useful for checking on any
previous discussion. Please let me know
if you have any questions or need
clarification. This shows you're open
and helpful. Best regards. A classic
formal closing for business emails. All
these phrases are great if you want to
sound professional in your emails, even
if you're still learning. That's right.
It's not about using big words. It's
about using the right tone and being
clear and polite.
Before
we move on, here's a quick Emma's tip.
Something simple you can do that makes a
big difference in your business English.
When you're writing an email or even
getting ready to make a phone call, try
this. Make a quick bullet point list of
your main ideas first. Just a short
outline. It helps you organize your
thoughts and stay focused. For example,
before writing an email, you might jot
down greeting, dear Mr. Turner, main
request, following up on the invoice.
Closing, please let me know if you have
questions. Then you can turn those
points into full sentences. It's much
easier, and it keeps your writing clear,
polite, and on track.
This trick works great for phone calls,
too. You can write down what you want to
say so you don't forget anything
important. I wish someone told me that
earlier. I used to go totally blank on
the phone.
That's why we're here. A little prep
goes a long way.
And now it's time for listener Q&A where
we answer your questions about real life
English. We got a really useful one
today from Aisha in Egypt. She asks,
"How can I politely ask a colleague to
reschedule a meeting via email?" That's
a fantastic question, Aisha. Thank you.
It really is. Rescheduling meetings
happens all the time in business and
doing it politely makes a big difference
in maintaining good relationships. So,
let's walk through it step by step.
First, always start with a friendly and
respectful greeting. Something like,
"Hi, write the name. I hope you're doing
well." It's warm and professional. Then,
you explain the situation briefly and
politely. A great phrase is,
"Unfortunately, I have a conflict at the
scheduled time." Or, "I'm afraid I won't
be able to attend our meeting as
planned." That sounds polite without
going into too much detail. Right? And
now for the reschedule request. This is
where polite modals really help. Use
phrases like, "Would it be possible to
reschedu?" "Could we move the meeting to
another time?" Would you mind changing
the meeting to a later date? These
expressions show respect and
flexibility. And it's always helpful to
suggest alternative times to make it
easier for the other person to respond.
For example, would Tuesday at 10:00 a.m.
work for you? I'm available on Wednesday
afternoon if that's more convenient.
Also, don't forget to apologize politely
for the change. A simple, I apologize
for any inconvenience this may cause or
I'm really sorry for the short notice.
These phrases show you value their time.
Let's put it all together in an example.
Here's how a complete email might look.
The subject request to reschedule
meeting. Dear Carlos, I hope you're
doing well. I'm writing to let you know
that I have a prior commitment on Monday
and unfortunately won't be able to make
our 300 p.m. meeting. Would it be
possible to reschedule our meeting for
Tuesday at the same time? I apologize
for the short notice and any
inconvenience this may cause. Thank you
for your understanding. Best regards,
Aisha. Perfect tone, polite, clear, and
respectful. And notice how Aisha used
expressions like would it be possible, I
apologize, and thank you for your
understanding. These are soft,
professional, and very natural in
workplace emails. So Aisha and everyone
listening, when you need to reschedu,
just remember the key ingredients. a
polite greeting, a clear explanation, a
soft, respectful request using would or
could, suggested times, a brief apology,
and a thank you. That's a great formula.
You're not just moving a meeting. You're
showing that you respect people's time
and want to work together smoothly. And
that's good communication, the heart of
business English. Thanks again to Aisha
for the question. If you have one for
us, send it in. We might answer it in a
future episode. Coming up next, our
speaking challenge to help you put
today's vocabulary into action. Stay
with us. You're almost at the finish
line.
Now, listeners, it's your turn. We have
a special speaking challenge for you.
Get ready. We want you to speak out loud
a sentence using one of today's key
phrases. For example, I will follow up
with the client next week. Go ahead, say
it.
Great. Now, try making your own sentence
with follow up. For example, I will
follow up with my boss after the
meeting. Now, you try. Write it in the
comments or say it out loud. We'd love
to see your sentence. Perfect. For a
second challenge, use the word deadline
in a sentence. For example, our deadline
is next Friday. Now you try. My deadline
is
share it. Remember, practicing by
speaking out loud really helps you
remember. Go ahead, give it a try. We'll
wait. Awesome job. Keep practicing and
you'll be confident using these phrases
in real situations.

[Music]
Hey there friends. Welcome back to the
English phrases Hub podcast. Your fun
and friendly place to learn real life
English through everyday conversations,
laughs, and practical tips. I'm Emma,
your language guide for the day. And I'm
Jake. Hello everyone. Whether you're
planning a wedding, attending one soon,
or just love romantic comedies, this
episode is going to be a real treat.
That's right. Today's episode is all
about weddings and marriage vocabulary.
Words, phrases, idioms, and expressions
you'll hear at ceremonies, in wedding
invitations, or even in romantic movies.
We'll teach you things like what it
means to pop the question, tie the knot,
and how to give a toast at a reception.
And yes, I might get a few things wrong
along the way, as usual. But don't
worry, we'll keep it simple, clear, and
fun. We'll also dive into some cultural
differences between British and American
weddings. Did you know a bachelorette
party is called a hen party in the UK? I
always thought hens were chickens. Not
quite, Jake, but that's the kind of fun
we'll have today. Learning through
conversation, laughter, and real life
examples. We've also prepared some
roleplay scenes like inviting someone to
a wedding, shopping for rings, and
giving a wedding toast so you can hear
the vocabulary in action. Plus, there's
a special segment called Jake's Mistake,
a tip from me to help you remember
today's phrases, a listener Q&A, and a
speaking challenge to practice your
English out loud. So, grab your
notebook, settle in, and let's make
learning English a piece of wedding
cake. Aw, that was sweet. Let's get
started with the words and phrases you
need to speak confidently about weddings
and marriage.
I have a question. My friend just got
engaged and I want to say the right
thing. What word should I use? Congrats
to your friend, Jake. After someone
proposes, they become engaged. The man
is called the fiance and the woman the
fiance. Fiance and fiance. Okay. And on
the wedding day, the woman is the bride
and the man is the groom. Exactly. The
bride and groom exchange vows. Those are
promises like, "I will love you
forever." After they say I do, they're
officially married as husband and wife.
Nice. And after the ceremony comes the
reception, which is like the big party
with food, music, and dancing. People
often give speeches and toasts to the
couple there. Yes. The toast is when
someone raises a glass and wishes the
couple well. For example, to the happy
couple, congratulations and a joyful
future together. If the couple wants to
skip a big wedding and just run off,
that's called to elope. Right. Right. To
elope means to run away and get married
secretly, often without telling anyone.
It's romantic in a spontaneous kind of
way. A lot of couples elope in places
like Las Vegas or even at a courthouse.
Who else has special roles at a wedding?
Well, the groom usually has a best man
and the bride has a maid of honor or
matron of honor if she's married.
They're the main helpers of the couple.
Bridesmaids are friends of the bride and
groomsmen help the groom. And what about
the kids? I remember seeing some
adorable little ones in weddings. Aw.
Yes. The flower girl walks down the
aisle throwing petals and the ring
bearer, usually a young boy, carries the
wedding rings on a tiny pillow. They add
that sweet, heartwarming moment to the
ceremony. Interested. I heard the word
officient. What's that again? The
officient is the person who conducts the
ceremony. It could be a priest, pastor,
rabbi, or even a civil cbrant or justice
of the peace. They're the ones who say,
"Do you take this person?" and declare,
"I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Got it. And after the wedding comes the
honeymoon, right? Exactly. The honeymoon
is the vacation newlyweds take. Right
after the wedding to relax and celebrate
privately, it's often to a romantic
destination like a beach resort, a cabin
in the mountains, or a city in Europe.
What do people usually wear at weddings?
Oh, good one. The bride usually wears a
wedding dress or gown, sometimes with a
veil. The groom wears a tuxedo or suit.
Guests are expected to wear formal
attire or semiformal clothing depending
on the invitation. Speaking of the
invitation, what does RSVP mean? Ah, it
stands for the French phrase repond
silvu play, which means please respond.
So, if you get an invitation, they
expect you to say whether or not you'll
attend the wedding. Makes sense. And
what are those tiny gifts guests get?
Sometimes those are called wedding
favors. Small gifts like candles,
chocolates, or keepsakes to thank guests
for coming. They're placed on the tables
or handed out at the end of the
reception.
And what do people usually say to the
happy couple? You can say things like,
"Congratulations,
best wishes to the bride and groom, or
wishing you a lifetime of love and
laughter." Some people even write
heartfelt messages in the guest book.
Guest book? Yep. A guest book is a
special notebook or photo album where
guests can write short notes, advice, or
memories. It becomes a beautiful
keepsake for the couple. That's so
sweet. What happens after the wedding
day? After the big day, the couple
becomes known as newlyweds for a while.
Then life returns to normal, except now
they're officially married.
This is really helpful. So many terms.
Ready to quiz me? Almost. But first,
shall we learn some fun wedding idioms
like tie the knot, cold feet, and match
made in heaven? Yes, please. Let's do
the idioms next.
Hit me with an idiom, Emma. All right,
let's start with a classic. Tie the
knot. Do you know what it means? H I'd
guess it means tying two things
together. Like you tie a knot with rope.
It does sound literal, right? But in
English, tie the knot actually means to
get married. The expression comes from
an old tradition where couples would
literally tie a knot in cloth or rope to
symbolize their union. Kind of like
saying we're bound together. Oh wow. I
didn't know that. So if someone says
they tied the knot last summer, they
mean the couple got married. Exactly.
It's a common and sweet way to say it.
Nice. What's next? Let's go with a match
made in heaven. This idiom describes a
couple that's just perfect for each
other. Like they were meant to be.
Teasing
like peanut butter and jelly. laughs.
Yes. Or cookies and milk or coffee and
mornings.
I like that one. So when people say a
match made in heaven, they mean the
couple fit so well together it's almost
magical. Yep. It suggests fate brought
them together. It's a great phrase to
use in a wedding toast, by the way.
Noted. Okay, next one. Pop the question.
I hear that all the time. Ah, yes. To
pop the question means to propose
marriage. So, if someone says, "He
popped the question last night." It
means he asked, "Will you marry me?"
Usually with a ring, right? Chuckles.
Yes. And probably on one knee if they're
going traditional. It's called pop
because it's kind of sudden, like a
surprise moment. Got it. So, it has
nothing to do with popcorn. laughs. Not
unless it's a movie themed proposal.
Now, what about cold feet? I once heard
someone say, "He's getting cold feet
before the wedding." That's a good one.
To get cold feet means to feel nervous
or uncertain before a big event,
especially a wedding. It doesn't mean
your toes are actually cold. It's about
hesitation or second thoughts.
Okay, good. I was about to grab some
warm socks. laughs. No need. It's just
anxiety. Everyone feels it sometimes
before major life decisions. Here's one
I've always found funny. Got hitched.
What's the story there? Oh, that one's
fun. Got hitched is informal slang for
got married. It comes from the idea of
hitching two things together, like
horses to a wagon. So when you say they
got hitched, it means they join their
lives together in marriage. Kind of
country sounding, huh? Totally. It has a
laidback, rustic vibe. You'll hear it in
western movies or casual conversations.
All right. How about wedding bells? I've
heard phrases like, "I hear wedding
bells." That's a romantic one. Wedding
bells are ringing or I hear wedding
bells means someone's about to get
married or people think they will. It's
poetic. Imagine a church with bells
ringing to announce a celebration. So if
I'm dating someone and people say, "Ooh,
I hear wedding bells." They mean they
think I might propose soon. Exactly.
It's often used in a teasing or hopeful
way, like your friends hinting that it's
time for you to pop the question.
Uh-oh, pressure's on.
Careful, Jake. You might tie the knot
before you know it. Note cold feet here,
Emma. These idioms are awesome. Got
more. I do. How about we do a quick
recap of what we've learned? Hold on,
Emma. We'll do a full review and recap
all the vocabulary phrases and idioms at
the end of the episode. Don't rush the
fun.
All right. All right. No spoilers then.
Let's keep the learning going. Okay.
Now, let's listen to a short dialogue
using some of these expressions and then
break it down together.
Hi, Aunt Lucy. It's Jake. I have some
exciting news. Emma and I are getting
married next month. Oh my goodness,
Jake. That's wonderful news. I'm so
happy for both of you. Thank you. We're
really excited. We'd love for you to
come to our wedding. It's going to be on
June 15th at Rosewood Park. The ceremony
will start at 3 p.m. followed by
reception with cake, music, and dancing
at the Grand Ballroom nearby. That
sounds absolutely lovely. Rosewood Park
is such a beautiful place for a wedding.
Yeah, we thought it would be perfect
outdoors, lots of flowers in bloom, and
we're keeping it simple but elegant. I'm
sure it'll be beautiful. Thank you so
much for inviting me. Of course. We
wouldn't imagine the day without you.
I'll be sending you a formal invitation
in the mail soon with all the details,
the address, dress code, and RSVP
information.
Wonderful. Please tell Emma I said
congratulations and I can't wait to see
you both. I wouldn't miss it for the
world. That means a lot, Aunt Lucy.
We're really looking forward to seeing
you there and celebrating together. Me,
too. Now I need to start thinking about
what to wear.
Just bring your smile. That's all we
need. See you soon. You got it. Take
care, Jake.
Welcome to Diamond Dreams. Are you
looking for wedding rings today? Yes, I
am. My fiance and I are getting married
next month, and I'm here to pick out our
wedding bands. That's wonderful.
Congratulations. Do you have something
specific in mind? Yes, he prefers a
classic gold band, and I'd like
something that matches, but with a small
diamond. Nothing too flashy, just
elegant. I have just the thing. Here are
some classic gold bands for men. And
over here we have matching styles for
women with a subtle diamond accent.
Would you like to try a few on? Sure.
Oh, I really like this one. It's simple
but has just the right sparkle. Great
choice. It's one of our most popular
designs. Would you like to engrave
anything inside the ring? Many couples
add their wedding date, initials, or a
short phrase. Yes, I'd love that. Please
engrave our wedding date June 15th
inside both bands. Of course. We'll make
sure it's perfect. The engraving takes
about 2 to 3 days and we'll package them
in a beautiful box. That sounds perfect.
Thank you so much. My pleasure.
Congratulations again. These rings are
going to be a lovely reminder of your
special day.
Hey, Emma. Only a few more days until
the big day. How are you feeling?
Honestly, I'm super excited, but I've
got a bit of the wedding jitters. Aw,
totally normal. Everyone gets cold feet
before they walk down the aisle, even if
their head over heels in love. Right. I
know I want to tie the knot with Jake,
but there's just so much going on. Last
minute planning, outfit changes, guests
asking questions. I just want everything
to be perfect. It will be perfect. You
and Jake are a match made in heaven.
Seriously, you've got this. Thanks,
Sofh. That means a lot. I still remember
the day he popped the question. I was in
total shock. I bet he did good with the
proposal, huh? Oh, yes. He got down on
one knee, said the sweetest words, and I
immediately said yes. I didn't even let
him finish. That's adorable. So, what
are you most excited about? Honestly,
saying I do in front of everyone and the
cake and dancing, but mostly just
sealing the deal and starting our new
life together. That's beautiful. I'm so
happy for you, Emma. Thank you. Now,
let's just hope I don't trip in my heels
walking down the aisle.
If you do, own it. You'll still be the
most stunning bride there.
Deal. See you soon. Can't wait.
Welcome back, everyone. That was fun,
wasn't it? I love hearing our fictional
selves planning the big day. So real.
Now, it's time to break down the three
dialogues you just heard. Yep. Let's
help you review some of the key phrases,
idioms, and useful vocabulary you heard.
We'll go one dialogue at a time. Okay,
so dialogue one was my phone call to
Aunt Lucy, inviting her to the wedding.
Let's talk about the key expressions.
The first one is, we'd love for you to
come to our wedding. That's a warm and
polite way to invite someone. And then
there's I'll send you a formal
invitation. That's the physical or
digital card people receive with the
wedding details like time, place, and
RSVP info. Don't forget reception.
That's the celebration after the
ceremony with food, music, cake, and
dancing. Oh, and Aunt Lucy said, "I
wouldn't miss it for anything." A great
phrase to show you're excited and
definitely coming. In dialogue two, I
was picking out wedding bands. That's
the ring a couple wears after they get
married, right? And the jeweler offered
engraving, which means carving words or
initials into the inside of the ring,
like your wedding date, June 15th. In
our story, you also heard words like
classic gold band, diamond accent, and
matching styles. All useful when talking
about wedding rings or jewelry in
general. I like that they talked about
getting it engraved with a personal
touch. That's common in many cultures.
Now, let's move to the dialogue three.
This one's fun because it's full of
wedding idioms. Let's go through them.
First up, tie the knot. One of the most
common ways to say get married in
English. Then there's pop the question,
which means to propose marriage, like he
popped the question last weekend. Don't
forget wedding jitters and cold feet.
Both are about feeling nervous before
the big event. But don't worry, it's
normal. I also used walk down the aisle,
which means to participate in the
wedding ceremony, literally walking
toward your partner. And we had a match
made in heaven. That sweet expression
for a couple that's just perfect for
each other. One more. Seal the deal. It
means to finalize something important,
like getting married. Business people
say it, too. But in weddings, it's about
making it official. So, those were our
three dialogues full of realistic
situations and natural English phrases.
And remember, the best way to learn
these is to practice using them. Maybe
tell someone about a wedding you
attended or make up your own dialogue or
roleplay with a friend. One of you can
be the bride or groom, the other a
guest, florist, or baker.
Get creative. Coming up next, we'll give
you a mini quiz to review what you've
learned. Let's see who's ready to tie
the knot with English Indians.
But before that, we're diving into
something really fun. Yep. Let's talk
about cultural differences in wedding
language between British and American
English. Because even when we're both
speaking English, we don't always say
things the same way. Let's go.
Let's compare British and American
weddings. Sure. Like, what's the UK
version of a bachelor party? In Britain,
a groom's bachelor party is called a
stag night or stagd. And a bride's
bachelorette is called a hen party. Hen
party? That sounds like a chicken farm.
I know it's funny, but it just means a
lady's party. Nothing to do with actual
chickens. Another difference in England,
weddings often happen in the morning.
Guys might wear a morning suit, a fancy
tail coat and striped pants, and ladies
wear dresses with hats or fascinators.
In the US, tuxedos and simpler dresses
are more common, and hats are rare.
Interesting. And after the ceremony,
both have a reception, of course. In the
UK, people sometimes call it a wedding
breakfast, but it's just lunch or
dinner, not breakfast foods. That can
confuse Americans.
In America, we have a rehearsal dinner
the night before the wedding. Do Brits
do that? Usually not. British weddings
often skip a big pre-wedding dinner.
They might have a big lunch or brunch on
the wedding day instead. No formal
dinner the night before like in the US.
Also, in the UK, you can't just marry
anywhere. Legally, weddings must take
place in a church or a venue officially
licensed for marriages. In the US,
couples can get married almost anywhere,
a garden, a beach, even in their
backyard. Got it. Most phrases are the
same on both sides. We all say, "I do."
And till death do us part. Exactly. The
traditions and sayings overlap a lot,
but it's fun to know the small
differences.
Emma, I think I might have cold feet.
What? Cold feet? Are you okay? Look, my
actual feet are freezing. Feel this.
They're like ice cubes.
Jake, that's not what it means, silly.
Cold feet isn't about your toes being
cold. It means you're nervous, like
second-guessing a big decision. It's
totally normal before a wedding. Oh, I
thought I needed thermal socks. I even
googled best pre-wedding foot warmers.
I can't believe you actually took it
literally.
That's not even the worst part. When you
said we were going to tie the knot, I
thought it was some kind of fancy shoe
tying ceremony. I practiced for hours.
What did you even do? I tied my
shoelaces together and then almost fell
down the stairs. Oh no. Well, I can
promise you you don't need a shoelace
degree to get married. Tie the knot just
means to get married. Right. Right.
Okay. But wait, there's more. When you
told me about your friend popping the
question, I thought he did it with like
an actual balloon. I imagined him
saying, "Will you marry me?" And then
pop confetti everywhere.
That would be adorable. But no, no
balloons involved. Pop the question just
means to propose. So no socks, no knots,
no balloons. This wedding is not what I
expected.
Welcome to the world of English idioms.
Confusing, but kind of fun, right?
Honestly, very fun. Thanks for saving my
feet, my dignity, and probably my shoes.
I'll remember these now. Just remember
one more thing. What? Say I do. Not I
tied my laces.
Deal. But I still might bring a balloon
just in case.
Here's a little tip to help you remember
one of those idioms. Tie the knot.
Picture this. You're sitting down to put
on your shoes. You take the laces, loop
them around, and make a tight little
knot. Now, think of marriage the same
way. Two people bringing their lives
together and making a strong connection,
just like tying two ends of a shoelace.
That's where the expression comes from.
In old traditions, some couples actually
had their hands or cloth tied together
in a ceremony, literally tying a knot to
symbolize unity. Oh, wow. I didn't know
there was actual knot tying in history.
That makes the phrase way more
meaningful. Exactly. So, next time you
hear someone say they tied the knot,
imagine those shoelaces coming together.
A strong, supportive, unbreakable loop.
Marriage is kind of like that. It takes
teamwork and a good double knot.
Double knot. Check. Shoelaces officially
engraved in my memory. Now, good. And
here's another memory trick. Use visual
images, even silly ones. The more you
see it in your mind, the more likely it
is to stick. So, if I picture me tying a
giant wedding bow with shoelaces, that
works. Totally works. The funnier or
more personal the image, the better.
That's how our brains lock in these
idioms. I now pronounce you left shoe
and right shoe forever tied.
And that's a step in the right
direction.
Now, let's answer a question from one of
our listeners. Today's question comes
from Maria in Germany. She asks, "What's
the difference between fiance and bride?
When do you use each word?" Great
question, Maria. Fiance for a man or
fiance for a woman refers to someone who
is engaged to be married. You use that
word after the proposal and before the
wedding. For example, when Jon proposes
and Mary says yes, John is Mary's fiance
and Mary is Jon's fiance during their
engagement. And the word bride is used
on the wedding day itself. On the
wedding day, Mary is the bride. After
the ceremony, Mary is John's wife and
John is Mary's husband. Exactly. Next
question. Lisa in Brazil asks, "What is
a bridal shower and how is it different
from a bachelorette party?" Good one. A
bridal shower is a party held before the
wedding where the bride to be receives
gifts from friends and family, things
she might need for married life. It's
mostly a US tradition. A bachelorette
party, called a hen party in the UK, is
a celebration with the bride's close
friends, like a fun night out. So, a
shower is about giving gifts, while a
bachelorette or hen party is more about
partying and fun.
Another question from Carlos in Mexico.
What does it mean when the father of the
bride gives her away? That's a
traditional part of many weddings. It
means the father walks the bride down
the aisle and then gives her away to the
groom. Symbolically, he's entrusting his
daughter to her new husband. It's an old
custom, but still often done today.
Next, Natalie in Canada asks, "What is a
honeymoon?" A honeymoon is the trip or
vacation the newlyweds take right after
the wedding. It's their special time to
relax and celebrate together. For
example, they might travel to a beach
resort or a romantic city. Akmed from
Egypt asks, "When someone says wedding
bells, what does that mean?" Wedding
bells is a phrase meaning a wedding is
about to happen. If someone says wedding
bells are ringing, it means someone is
getting married soon. It's like
imagining the church bells announcing
the wedding. One more from Peter in
London. I've heard brides say something
old, something new, something borrowed,
something blue. What's that? That's a
traditional good luck bime. It means the
bride should wear something old like a
family heirloom, something new, like her
new dress, something borrowed from
another married friend, and something
blue like a ribbon or garter. Each piece
is thought to bring luck to the
marriage. Great questions. Thanks to
everyone who wrote in.
All right, listeners, it's recap time.
Let's go over some of the wedding words
and idioms we learned today. Yep. If
you're taking notes, now is the time to
grab that notebook. Let's start at the
beginning. First up, bride and groom.
The bride is the woman getting married,
and the groom is the man. Easy enough.
So, on our wedding day, you're the bride
and I'm the groom. Unless I get cold
feet.
Don't worry, we'll get to that idiom in
a minute. Next, engaged. That means
you've agreed to marry someone and the
person you're engaged to is your fiance
if they're male or fiance if they're
female. Spelled differently, but they
sound almost the same. Classic English
confusion. Then there's the big moment,
the proposal. That's when someone asks,
"Will you marry me?" Right? And the
informal idiom for that is pop the
question. It's got nothing to do with
balloons, sadly, or popcorn. Next, let's
talk about wedding vows. These are the
promises made during the ceremony.
You'll hear things like, "I promise to
love and support you," or the classic,
"I do." And if someone's writing their
own vows, it means they're making them
personal and unique. Super touching.
After the ceremony, it's time to party.
That's the reception. Food, music, cake,
dancing, and maybe some awkward toasts
from relatives.
[Laughter]
Speaking of that, a wedding toast is
when someone raises a glass and gives a
short congratulatory speech to the
couple. something like to the happy
couple, may your life be full of love
and laughter. Now, if someone skips the
whole wedding party and runs off to get
married secretly, that's called eloping,
right? No guests, no cake, just love and
a courthouse or a trip to Vegas.
And what's the phrase we've been using
all episode? That's right, tie the knot.
It's an idiom that means to get married.
Fun fact, some ancient wedding
traditions actually involved tying cloth
or hands together to symbolize unity.
Aw, so romantic and way less complicated
than seating charts. Another sweet idiom
is a match made in heaven, which means
the couple is perfect for each other,
like peanut butter and jelly or tea and
biscuits. Very British. Now, let's go
back to something Jake mentioned
earlier. Cold feet. It doesn't mean your
toes are freezing. It means you're
getting nervous before the wedding. I
still say I had both nerves and chilly
toes. Next, let's talk about the wedding
party. If you're taking notes, now's the
time to grab that notebook. Let's start
at the beginning. Jake, here's a UK
versus US twist. In Britain, the
pre-wedding party for the bride is a hen
party, and for the groom, it's a stag
night. In the US, it's called a
bachelorette party and a bachelor party.
Same purpose, one last big night out
before tying the knot. And then we have
the best man and the maid of honor.
These are the bride and groom's main
attendants, kind of like the team
captains. The best man usually holds the
rings, gives a toast, and tries not to
forget the speech.
And the maid of honor helps the bride
with everything from planning to fixing
her dress on the big day. Don't forget
the wedding invitation. That's the fancy
card you send out with the date, time,
and RSVP details. And in the US, there's
often a rehearsal dinner the night
before the wedding. It's like a practice
run with food. In the UK, that's not so
common. You just show up and hope
everyone knows where to stand.
After the wedding, the couple goes on a
honeymoon, a romantic trip to relax and
celebrate their new life together.
Beach, mountains, Europe, whereever
makes you both happy. Oh, and let's not
forget the bridal shower, a gift party
for the bride, mostly in the US. It's
usually hosted by friends or family
before the wedding. And at the actual
ceremony, you often see a flower girl
scattering petals and a ring bearer,
usually a little boy, carrying the
rings. Super cute and usually the stars
of the show for about 60 seconds.
So, that's a wrap on our vocabulary
recap. Try repeating these words out
loud, or better yet, use them in your
own wedding story or roleplay.
Now, it's your turn. Here's your
speaking challenge. Imagine your friend
just got engaged. Use at least three
phrases from today to congratulate them.
For example, you could say, "Wow, you're
engaged. You and your partner are a
match made in heaven. When do you tie
the knot?
Try pausing the show and saying
something like that out loud. Go ahead
and practice. Remember, mistakes are
okay. Just have fun. We're sure you'll
do great. Keep practicing by talking
about any wedding or engagement you know
of. You'll get even more comfortable
with these words. And that wraps up our
episode all about wedding and marriage
vocabulary. From proposals to
receptions, we hope you had fun and
picked up a ton of useful phrases today.
It was a blast. And now, whether you're
tying the knot, popping the question, or
just attending a friend's wedding,
you'll be ready to talk about it
confidently in English. Remember, the
best way to make this vocabulary stick
is to use it, speak it, write it, and
have fun with it. Try the speaking
challenge again later, or even roleplay
one of the dialogues with a friend. And

things off with our first funny role
play. And trust me, it's going to be a
piece of cake.
[Music]
Emma, I have my big audition tomorrow
and honestly, I'm freaking out a little.
My hands are sweaty. My heart's racing.
And I can't even remember the first
line. Hey, take a deep breath. You've
been practicing for weeks. You've got
this.
I hope so. What if I trip on stage? What
if I forget my lines? What if my voice
cracks and I sound like a goose? Then
you'll still be the best goose they've
ever seen. Seriously, you'll do great.
Just remember to project your voice and
break a leg. Break a Wait, what? Emma,
did you just say break a leg? Are you
trying to jinx me? No. No jinxing here.
Break a leg is just an idiom. It means
good luck, especially in the theater
world.
But why would anyone say something that
sounds so painful to wish someone luck?
Ah, the magic of English. No one really
knows where it came from, but it's part
of tradition. Some people believe it
started as a way to avoid bad luck, like
saying the opposite of what you want.
So, the good stuff actually happens.
So, if I told you fall flat on your
face, I'd actually be wishing you
success. Well, not exactly. Let's not
invent any new idioms today. Stick with
break a leg. Okay. Okay. So, break a leg
means good luck and not go injure
yourself on stage. That's oddly
comforting. Exactly. So, when your
director or co-star says it before you
go on, just smile and say, "Thanks."
All right, then. Tomorrow I walk in,
smile at the judges, and say, "Hi, I'm
Jake and I'm here to break my leg for
you." No, no, no, no. Don't say that.
Just say your name and do your scene.
Let them say break a leg to you. Okay,
got it. Note to self, do not mention
actual leg breaking in audition. You're
going to do great, Jake. Just trust
yourself, stay calm, and enjoy the
moment. And yes, break a leg. Thanks,
Emma. I feel better now. And if all else
fails, I'll just pretend I'm in a comedy
and trip on purpose. Instant applause,
right? Only if you fall in style. Now go
practice your lines one more time and
then get some rest. Tomorrow's your big
day, right? Deep breath,
posture up,
break a leg. Not literally, Jake. Please
just do your best. And maybe avoid any
tap dancing near the edge of the stage.
Deal. Let's do this.
All right, let's break it down. Break a
leg sounds like the opposite of what we
want, right? But it actually means good
luck, especially before a performance.
How did break a leg come to mean good
luck? It's an old tradition in theater.
One idea is that saying something
negative like breaking a leg will jinx
the bad luck. So it magically becomes
positive. Basically, instead of saying
good luck, you say something odd.
That's like a superstition. English is
full of those little quirks. Exactly. So
remember, break a leg. It's like saying
go get them. Got it. Next time if
someone says break a leg, I'll know
they're cheering for me, not wishing me
harm. Perfect. Here's a helpful trick
for remembering idioms. When you learn a
new idiom, like break a leg, picture it
as a funny or crazy scene. For example,
imagine someone accidentally breaking
their leg on stage. It's silly, right?
Now, flip the meaning in your mind.
Because the image is vivid, it'll help
you remember that break a leg means good
luck. Oh, so if I think of a clown
giving the actor a cast and wishing them
luck, I'll remember it's a joke phrase.
Exactly. Another tip, use the idiom soon
after you learn it. If you say break a
leg to a friend tomorrow, you'll never
forget its meaning. Practice makes it
stick. Great advice. Okay, I'll picture
someone slipping on the stage and then
saying, "Good luck." Got it.
M. This strawberry pie is delicious.
After that big meal, this is just
perfect. It sure is. Tasting this pie is
a piece of cake, isn't it? Well, it is
literally a piece of cake.
That's the pun. In English, we say a
piece of cake to mean something is very
easy. Oh, so you mean tasting this pie
was easy? Exactly. We might say
finishing that puzzle was a piece of
cake, meaning it was really simple. Got
it. So, it's a fun way to say easy using
cake. Yes. And speaking of paying for
this food, I can grab my wallet. No,
I'll pay. Don't worry, I'll foot the
bill. Foot the bill? Yeah, foot the
bill.
Oh dear, you're literally stepping on
the check. Sorry, I thought that was
what it meant. But actually, you pay
money with your foot. No, it doesn't
involve feed at all. To foot the bill
means to pay for everything, like
covering the restaurant bill. So, I
won't have to bring my foot to the
cashier.
No, just hand them money. It's an idiom,
like a funny way of talking about
paying. English sure loves its
expressions. Okay, I'll foot the bill in
the sense of paying with my credit card.
All right, let's take a moment to break
those idioms down clearly. First up, a
piece of cake. Now, I know it sounds
delicious, but in English, it doesn't
mean actual cake. Although, having cake
nearby never hurts. Unless it's
chocolate, then I get distracted and
forget what we're talking about.
Exactly. But in this case, a piece of
cake just means something is very easy.
Like, if you studied for a test and knew
all the answers, you could say that test
was a piece of cake.
So, it's like saying that was no problem
or that was super simple. Exactly. It's
a way of saying that task was easy, no
stress. We use it all the time. The
directions were a piece of cake.
Learning this phrase, piece of cake. All
right, then. This podcast is a piece of
cake. That's the spirit. Now, the next
idiom, foot the bill. And no, you don't
have to take off your shoe to use this
one. That's a relief. I was worried we'd
be paying with toes.
Nope, not even close. To foot the bill
means to pay for the whole thing.
Especially when you're covering the cost
for other people. Like if we go out to
eat and you say, "Don't worry, I'll foot
the bill." It means you're offering to
pay for everyone.
So, if I invite friends to dinner and
foot the bill, I'm being generous.
Exactly. It's often used in group
settings, restaurants, parties, even
work events. My company footed the bill
for our conference trip. Her parents
footed the bill for the wedding. So,
cake equals easy. Foot equals pay. Got
it. Easy as pie or cake.
Yep. We like dessert-based expressions,
and those idioms are easy to use once
you get used to them. I always suggest
trying to use a new idiom in your own
sentence right after you learn it. That
helps it stick in your brain. Curious.
What if I'm not sure what an idiom means
right away? Great question. Here's a
quick tip. Pay attention to the
situation. When someone says an idiom
and you're not sure what it means, look
around. What's happening? What are
people doing? What's the tone? Like
reading the room. Exactly. For example,
if you're at a restaurant and someone
says, "I'll foot the bill." No one is
using their foot. But the setting, a
restaurant, the end of a meal, tells you
it's about paying. So the context gives
you clues. That's actually really
helpful. It works with a lot of idioms,
and if the meaning still isn't clear,
it's totally okay to ask. Native
speakers often forget how strange these
expressions can sound at first.
Honestly, if I didn't know better, I
would have thought people in
English-speaking countries were obsessed
with dessert and accidents.
That's not entirely wrong. All right,
now that we've cleared up those, let's
move to another classic and slightly
absurd idiom. Oh no, let me guess. More
food or maybe falling animals? You're
not far off. Our next idiom is raining
cats and dogs. Listen carefully to the
next conversation and see if you can
guess what it really means.
Oh no, I knew I should have brought a
coat. Look at this weather. It's pouring
out here. Wow, it's absolutely raining
cats and dogs out here. Wait, what did
you just say? Cats and dogs. Are there
animals falling from the sky? Should we
call animal rescue?
Thankfully, no. That would be terrifying
and messy. Raining cats and dogs is just
a silly English idiom that means it's
raining very heavily. Like really
heavily. Phew. You had me worried there
for a second. I actually looked up just
to check. No cats, no dogs, just water.
I love that you checked. But yes, it
just means a downpour. Lots and lots of
rain. You'll hear people say it when
it's pouring, not just drizzling. Good
to know. So, if it's just a little
sprinkle, do we say raining kittens and
puppies?
No. But that would be adorable. We'd
probably say something like light rain
or a drizzle. The cats and dogs are
saved for the really dramatic storms.
So, this is officially cats and dogs
level. Oh, 100%. This is a full animal
shelter falling from the clouds.
In my language, we say it's raining
buckets. Like you imagine someone
pouring giant buckets of water from the
sky. I love that. And it makes sense.
Very visual. Just like raining cats and
dogs. It's meant to sound wild and
exaggerated. Different languages,
different animals or objects. Same idea.
So idioms are like little stories people
say instead of just describing something
normally. Exactly. They're creative
shortcuts. Sometimes silly, sometimes
poetic, but always interesting. That's
why they can be confusing and fun at the
same time. Okay, then. Next time I hear
thunder and see sheets of rain like
this, I'll know what to say. Go on then,
practice the idiom. Wow, it's raining
cats and dogs out here. Yes, perfect.
Now, next time you use that phrase in
front of native speakers, they'll nod
and smile, not call the animal shelter.
Good, because I'm not carrying a cat
carrier in my backpack. Just snacks and
an umbrella. Snacks are way more useful.
Let's find shelter before we're soaked
to the bone. Agreed. And hey, thanks for
saving me from looking completely
confused in the next storm. Anytime. I'm
just glad we didn't need a boat to
record this podcast episode.
All right, let's break that one down
properly. The expression raining cats
and dogs might sound completely
ridiculous at first, and honestly, it
kind of is, but in English, it simply
means it's raining very heavily, like a
serious downpour. Okay, but where did
the animals come in? Why cats? Why dogs?
Why not frogs or fish?
Great question. The truth is, no one's
100% sure where the phrase originally
came from. There are a few theories,
though. Oh, now I'm curious. Give me the
weirdest one. All right. One old theory
is that in the 1600s in Europe, heavy
storms would flood streets so badly that
stray animals might be seen floating in
the water. People would say things like,
"It's raining so hard cats and dogs are
everywhere." And somehow that image
stuck. Wa, that's pretty dark. So, it
might have started from actual animals
during storms. That's one story. Another
possibility is that the phrase comes
from old folklore or writings where cats
were associated with strong winds and
dogs symbolized heavy rain. Put them
together and boom, you get a stormy
mess. So, it's a big storm with wild
wind and pouring rain. That definitely
sounds like a bunch of angry cats and
dogs. Exactly. It's not logical, but it
paints a vivid picture. And that's what
idioms often do. You imagine something
dramatic to describe something simple,
like the weather. Well, either way, if
someone says, "It's raining cats and
dogs. I'm staying indoors, ordering
soup, and not looking for puppies
falling from the clouds." Good plan. And
just so you know, this idiom is only
used for really heavy rain, not for
light rain, mist, or a drizzle. Right?
So raining cats and dogs means heavy
rain, like buckets of water. Drizzle is
light, gentle rain. And what if it's
somewhere in the middle? If it's steady
but not too intense, people might say
things like, "It's coming down
steadily." Or, "It's raining pretty
hard." But cats and dogs is more
colorful and dramatic. What about it's
raining elephants and whales? Can I
start that?
Maybe in your own idiom dictionary, but
for now, let's stick to the animals
English speakers expect. Got it. So,
next time I hear thunder and feel my
shoes fill with water, I'll know it's
raining cats and dogs, and that means
grab an umbrella and probably cancel any
outdoor plans. Exactly. And if you ever
forget what it means, just picture a
pack of cats chasing dogs through the
sky. That mental image will help you
remember. It's just extreme rain. It's
oddly helpful. I'll never forget it. Ow.
That's the power of idioms. Silly,
surprising, but super memorable.
Okay, everyone. It's time for our
favorite part of the show, Jake's
mistake. Oh no, what did I say this
time? Are we really doing this again?
Yes, we are. Because every mistake is a
chance to learn something new. And
believe me, today's one is super common
among English learners. All right, I'm
ready. Hit me with it. So last week,
Jake and I were having a conversation
about weekend plans. I suggested we
record two episodes on Sunday, and he
said, "I am agree with you." O, that one
hurts right in my grammar.
Hey, no shame. So many learners make
this exact mistake. It's totally normal,
but let's fix it so everyone gets it
right moving forward. I feel like I
should write I agree a hundred times on
the board. Great idea, Jake. But let's
explain it first. In English, we don't
say I am agree. The word agree is
already a verb. So, you don't need am.
You just say I agree. So, it's not like
I am happy or I am tired. Exactly. Good
point. Words like happy or tired are
adjectives. So you use am with them. But
agree is a verb on its own like run,
eat, or sleep. You wouldn't say I am
eat. Right. True. I wouldn't say I am
eat a sandwich. That sounds like a
robot. Exactly. Same goes for agree. So
the correct sentence is I agree with
you. Or if you want to sound a bit more
enthusiastic, you can say, I totally
agree. I completely agree. I agree 100%.
That's easy to remember now. So no am
I agree. Let me try again. Emma, I agree
with you that this is slightly
embarrassing.
Perfect. And it's okay to laugh at our
mistakes. It means we're learning.
Actually, if you ever hear someone say,
"I am agree," you'll know they're still
learning, too. And now you can help
them. I like that. It's cool how one
small word can make such a big
difference. Exactly. And mistakes like
these show how much language learning is
about noticing and practicing. So for
everyone listening, don't be afraid to
make mistakes. Just remember to learn
from them. Like Jake, thank you. Today's
grammar fail is tomorrow's success,
right? Absolutely. And you nailed it by
correcting yourself. So, one more time,
Jake, just to seal it in. I agree with
you. Yes. Nicely done. And that's
another Jake's mistake turned into a
win.
Time for our listener Q&A. We love
getting your questions. Our first
question is from Marta in Spain. What
does foot the bill actually mean? Do I
use my foot with the check?
Great question. As we just talked about,
foot the bill means to pay the bill to
cover the cost of the meal. You don't
use your foot at all, just your wallet.
Imagine you're at a restaurant. If you
say, "I'll foot the bill," you're
telling everyone you'll pay for it.
Exactly. The listener is a beginner
learner, so the key is context. At a
dinner, hearing foot the bill almost
always means pay. Okay. Second question
is from Anel in India. Why do you say
raining cats and dogs? Do Americans and
Brits really say that? We do use that
phrase in English. And no, we don't
think literal cats and dogs are falling.
It's just an idiom for very heavy rain.
It's a funny old expression. Many
English speakers know it, but it's not
taken seriously. Right. We just use it
in a joking way. If someone didn't know
the idiom, they might find it confusing.
But now Enel knows it's just about the
rain. Thanks for the great questions.
Keep them coming, everyone.
All right, it's time for a quick
vocabulary recap before we jump into our
next segment. Let's review the idioms
and phrases we covered today. Aka, let's
see how many mistakes I can not make
this time.
You'll do great, Jake. Let's start with
one of my favorites. Break a leg.
Remember that one? Oh, yes. And now I
know you weren't trying to send me to
the hospital, right? Break a leg is an
idiom that actually means good luck.
It's commonly used in the world of
theater, but people say it in other
situations, too, like before an exam, a
job interview, or even a big
presentation.
So, I could say, "You've got a big test
tomorrow. Break a leg." Exactly. And
remember, idioms don't always make
literal sense, but they add color to the
language. Got it. Next up, a piece of
cake. And no, it's not dessert time.
Sadly,
not yet. But in English, if something is
a piece of cake, it means it's very
easy. Like, that grammar quiz was a
piece of cake. Fixing the computer,
piece of cake for me.
Hosting this podcast. Piece of cake.
Nice. But now, let's talk money and
mistakes. How about foot the bill? Ah,
yes. I thought I needed an actual foot
at first, but foot the bill means to pay
for something. Usually when you cover
the full cost for a group. Perfect.
Like, don't worry, I'll foot the bill
for lunch. Her parents footed the bill
for the wedding. It's a polite way to
say someone's paying. I'll start using
it when I don't want to pay. Like, hey,
Emma, would you like to foot the bill
today?
I see what you're doing. Let's move on
quickly. Next one. Raining cats and
dogs. The one that almost had me
rescuing animals from the sky. Exactly.
Raining cats and dogs means it's raining
very heavily. Think pouring rain,
thunder, puddles everywhere. It's not
just a little drizzle, it's storm
weather. Like we were going to the park,
but it was raining cats and dogs, so we
stayed home. Perfect example. Now, let's
not forget our grammar fix of the day.
Something many learners get confused
about. I agree versus I am agree. Ah,
yes. My shining moment in Jake's
mistakes history. And you owned it. So
just remember agree is already a verb.
So you don't need am. We say I agree
with you. I totally agree but not I am
agree. I agree with that explanation.
See what I did there? Yes. Look at you
go. All right. Let's do a super quick
recap list for our listeners. Here's
what we covered.
Break a leg means good luck. Usually
said to performers, a piece of cake
means very easy. Foot the bill means to
pay for the total cost. Reigning cats
and dogs means raining heavily. I agree.
Correct way to say you share someone's
opinion. Don't say I am agree. That's a
lot of idioms in one episode. My brain
is full, but in a good way. Same here.
And remember, the more you hear these
phrases, the more natural they'll feel.
Try using just one of these today in a
real conversation. All right, I'll go
outside, wait for rain, and then shout,
"It's raining cats and dogs." Even if
it's sunny.
Please don't confuse the neighbors. But
yes, practice makes progress.
Now it's your turn. Try using one of
today's idioms in a sentence and say it
out loud. For example, you could say,
"Studying English with this podcast is a
piece of cake." Or, "I have a big
presentation tomorrow. Wish me luck.
Break a leg. Record yourself or practice
with a friend. The more you speak, the
more confident you'll become." You can
even share your sentences with us on
social media. We love seeing what you
come up with. It can be as simple as
saying the idiom by itself and
explaining it. The important part is
speaking it out loud. Have fun with it
and keep practicing.
And that's all for today's episode of
the English phrases hub podcast. We had
an absolute blast chatting about all
these funny English expressions from
break a leg to raining cats and dogs. We
hope you had as much fun as we did. And
more importantly, we hope you learned
something new. Idioms can be strange,
silly, and even confusing. But once you
start using them, they make your English
sound so much more natural.
And if you make a few grammar mistakes
along the way, don't worry. You'll just
end up in a fun podcast segment like
Jake's mistake. Exactly. Remember,
learning a language isn't about being
perfect. It's about being brave, making
mistakes, and laughing through the
process. Yes. Embrace your inner
confused English speaker. I sure do. But
hey, I really do feel like my English is
improving just from having these
conversations with you. And we love
hearing that. That's what we're here
for, to help make English learning fun,
practical, and a little silly, too. If

mistake or tell us an idiom from your
language that sounds totally wild in
English. We might even talk about it in
a future episode. Oh, yes, we'd love
that. And as always, if you want to keep
practicing, try using today's phrases in
real conversations. Even just with
yourself in the mirror. Seriously, it
helps. Just maybe avoid shouting, "It's
raining cats and dogs." If the sun is

and let's jump into episode two of the
English phrases Hub podcast. Let's do
it. Your next set of useful English
phrases starts right now.
So, Emma, how was your weekend? Oh,
pretty good. I went to a farmers market
on Saturday morning. You know, one of
those open air ones with fresh fruit,
homemade bread, and little craft stands.
Then I tried a new coffee shop in the
afternoon. Really cozy atmosphere. And
they had oat milk lattes. Total win.
What about you? That sounds amazing. I
actually binged a new series. Like I
watched six episodes in a row. So
basically, I practiced Netflix and chill
all weekend.
Now I need to get back to reality.
Classic weekend move. I've done that
before. One episode turns into five and
suddenly it's midnight. Are you feeling
ready for Monday, though? Well, kind of.
I stayed up late last night trying to
study some new English phrases.
Commitment, right? But then I missed the
last bus and ended up walking 30 minutes
home in the rain. Total movie scene
moment. Oh no. So you were literally
caught in the rain and now maybe feeling
a little under the weather, huh?
Exactly.
My shoes were soaked. But hey, at least
I got some fresh air and a free cardio
session. Let's call it an unplanned
fitness adventure. I love it. Sounds
like we both had busy weekends in our
own way. Mine was relaxing. Yours was
dramatic.
Yeah, but hey, nothing like a little
adventure to kick off the week. Speaking
of adventures, are you ready to dive
into today's first topic? Sure.
Imagine we're at the mall looking for a
jacket. Hm. Lots of nice jackets here.
I'll keep looking. I'm just browsing.
Thanks. Let me know if you need any
help. So, Jake, I see a sign 50% off
clearance sale. That's a good deal. Wow,
50% off. That's an awesome bargain. I
love a sale. Maybe I should try it on
here. Use the fitting room. How does it
fit? This jacket is really nice, but it
feels a bit snug on my shoulders. You
might need a larger size. They often
have a range of sizes, but popular ones
sell out fast. Check if they're out of
stock in your size. checking. Oh, it
says only M left. Large is out. H maybe
this store doesn't have it. We could ask
the saleserson if they can check another
branch or ask about a refund or exchange
option. Or maybe I'll just look for
another style or wait for the next big
sale event. Either way, I think we just
used a bunch of useful phrases. I said
just browsing. Good deal. Try it on and
out of stock without even thinking about
it. That's great. Using them in real
situations really helps them stick. You
also used bargain and fitting room.
Those are solid shopping vocabulary
terms in English. Right. And now I won't
forget them. Shopping can be fun and
educational.
Exactly. So whether you're shopping for
clothes, electronics, or groceries,
these phrases will definitely come in
handy.
Okay, next up, transportation.
Let's say I need to get downtown for a
meeting. Are you taking the subway or
the bus? I was planning on the bus, but
yesterday I missed the bus by just 1
minute, so I'm worried. Ouch, that's
annoying. Maybe leave a bit earlier.
There's often heavy traffic in the
morning, too. True. If traffic is bad,
the bus might be delayed. Maybe I should
try a different route. You could also
carpool with a friend or take a ride
sharing service. Sometimes I hop in an
Uber if I'm in a hurry. Good idea. When
I take the subway, it's usually on time,
but at night, it can be slow or even
stop more frequently. And don't forget
to check the schedule. If the train's
late, you could still catch a bus or
call a taxi. Yeah. Hey, I have an app on
my phone that tells me the bus arrival
time. It's so helpful, especially when
it's cold or raining to avoid waiting
outside too long. Nice. Using tech to
make life easier. I sometimes just jump
on my bike for short trips, too, or walk
if the weather's nice. It's good
exercise and helps me avoid the rush
hour crowd. True. When I'm not in a
rush, I love walking and listening to a
podcast like this one. Exactly. And we
just used a lot of practical travel
phrases without even trying. Let's
highlight a few for our listeners. Miss
the bus to arrive too late to catch it.
Heavy traffic. A lot of cars on the road
moving slowly. On time, arriving at the
scheduled time. Delayed. Arriving late.
Car poolool. Sharing a ride with others.
Ride sharing like Uber or Lift. Rush
hour. The busy time of day when many
people travel to or from work. These
phrases are super common in everyday
English. If you travel, even just around
your city, you'll hear and use these all
the time.
Now, let's talk about hobbies and
weekend plans. What do you like to do in
your free time, Jake? Well, I love
playing guitar and hanging out with
friends. On Fridays, we usually chill
out and play board games. It's our
little tradition. Sounds fun. I like to
take up a new hobby each year. Last year
it was painting. This year I started
jogging. That's awesome. I sometimes go
for a run, too. It's a good way to wind
down after work and clear my head.
Exactly. Sometimes I'm too tired though,
so I just kick back and watch a movie
instead. Netflix and chill, right?
Yes. in a friendly way. Of course, just
relaxing on the couch.
Yes, it's a common phrase these days.
But yeah, even just reading a book or
taking a long bath can help you relax
and recharge. True. Are you free this
Saturday? Maybe we can hang out and do
something fun. Sure. How about we visit
that new pottery class downtown? I've
always wanted to try making pottery.
That sounds interesting. I'd be willing
to give it a go. It could be a team
bonding sort of friend thing.
It's always good to uh try new hobbies.
Even if you fail, you learn something
new. Speaking of which, I tried rock
climbing once. I definitely need
practice and hopefully no injuries.
Don't worry, I didn't get hurt. But I
definitely discovered I'm more
comfortable with two feet on the ground.
All right, let's highlight a few key
phrases we just used. Hang out to spend
time socially.
Chill out. Kick back. To relax. Take up.
A hobby. To start doing something new
for fun. Wind down. to relax after a
busy or stressful time. Netflix and
chill. Informally used to describe a
night of watching shows and relaxing. Be
mindful. The phrase can have other
meanings depending on context.
And remember, talking about hobbies is a
great way to connect with people in
everyday English conversations. You
don't need perfect grammar. Just show
interest and share something about
yourself.
Finally, let's chat about technology and
gadgets. We both use our phones a lot,
right? Definitely. I downloaded a new
language app yesterday to help with
vocabulary. It's really handy. Has
little quizzes and flashcards. Nice. I
just got a new phone. It has an amazing
camera. Only problem is the battery
life's not great. I find myself needing
to charge it more often.
Aren't new phones notorious for that?
Just plug it in, friend. Yeah, charging
now. Also, have you tried the new
streaming app? I stream all my music on
it. It has a fantastic playlist feature,
perfect for a background music while I
work. I did. Streaming movies and music
is so easy now. Remember when we had to
download everything or buy CDs?
I still have some CDs in my closet.
Classic stuff. But seriously,
technologies changed everything. And
thanks to Wi-Fi, I can do all this
online without burning through my mobile
data. Right. And when it comes to
learning English, I use videos and
podcasts all the time for listening
practice. It's great that you can surf
the web or watch lessons on your phone
anywhere, anytime. Absolutely. Just
don't forget to take breaks. Too much
screen time can really strain your eyes.
True. I try to do short screen breaks.
During those, I sometimes jot down new
words I picked up while watching. Oh,
and speaking of tech, when we have a
meeting, we usually say, "Let me share
my screen." instead of passing paper
around. Yep. modern life. So, let's go
over some techreated phrases our
listeners might want to remember.
Download an app. Install an application
on your phone. Stream a movie or song.

Now, it's time for Jake's mistake. What
slip up do you have for us today, Jake?
Well, I learned this idiom the other
day. I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.
I was joking around, then realized,
Emma, did you think I meant it
literally?
Eat a horse? I thought you were just
hungry. Tries not to laugh. Yeah, I
meant the idiom. I said, "I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse, but kind of
seriously." Then I saw you looking
horrified, like I was planning a wild
lunch.
That's a classic idiom. It just means
I'm very, very hungry. But don't worry,
no one thinks you're actually planning
to eat a horse. In both American and
British English, it's just a silly
exaggeration.
Right. So basically it means I'm
starving, not I need literal horse meat.
Exactly. It's idiomatic.
You could also say something like I
could eat a whole elephant, but
honestly, I'm starving is the safest
bet, especially if you don't want to
freak people out at dinner. Good call.
Thanks for the save, Emma. I'll remember
to keep my hunger expressions slightly
less alarming.
All right, your mistake is safe with us.
Now, let's switch it over to something
more helpful. It's time for Emma's tip.
Thanks, Jake. Here's Emma's tip, and
today we're talking about a powerful way
to remember the phrases you've learned.
The shadowing technique. Shadowing, huh?
Sounds mysterious.
It's not magic, but it works really
well. Shadowing means repeating what you
hear immediately. Like you're the
speaker's echo. You copy not just the
words, but the tone, speed, and rhythm.
Oh, so it's like being a voice twin for
a few seconds. Exactly. It's a great way
to train your pronunciation and
listening skills. Let me show you. I'll
say a phrase. I'm just browsing. Then
you repeat right after me. Ready? I'm
just browsing.
Great. Now, let's try another one from
today. That's a good deal. That's a good
deal. Perfect. Doing this a few times,
especially with short phrases, helps
turn the language into muscle memory. It
feels more natural the more you do it.
That makes sense. I do that sometimes
when I watch shows. I pause and copy
what they say, even if I feel a bit
silly. That's actually another great way
to shadow using movies, YouTube, or even
this podcast. Pick one phrase and shadow
it three or four times. It sticks better
that way. I also like making flashcards,
one side with the phrase and the other
with the meaning or even a little
picture. Reviewing them on the go really
helps me remember. Yes, visuals work
really well, especially for visual
learners. And here's another idea. After
you shadow a phrase, try using it in
your own sentence.
like creating a mini dialogue or talking
to yourself about your day. Exactly. For
example, say, "I went shopping today and
told the clerk, I'm just browsing." That
way, the phrase becomes personal and
relevant to you. I like that. It's more
than memorizing. It's making the phrase
part of your daily vocabulary,
right? And don't stress if you forget at
first. It's normal. Practicing a little
every day, even five minutes, really
adds up. And I love what you always say,
have fun with it. Absolutely. The more
relaxed and playful you are, the easier
it is to learn. Make mistakes, laugh at
them, repeat phrases in a silly voice,
whatever keeps you motivated. That's
great advice, Emma. Shadowing, creating
sentences, using visuals. Mix it up and
find what works best for you.
Time for our listener Q&A. We got a
message from Maria in Spain. She asks,
"I feel shy and nervous speaking English
in front of others. How can I become
more confident and use these phrases
without hesitation?"
Great question, Maria. Ah, I've been
there. I once froze speaking English to
a class of 50 people. Not fun. First,
Maria, remember, everyone makes mistakes
when learning a language. Native
speakers make mistakes, too. What helped
me was practicing with a language buddy
or even talking to myself in the mirror.
Pretend you're explaining something to a
friend. Yes. And start small. Maybe
practice these phrases with a friend or
classmate who's also learning. You can
roleplay different scenarios like one
person is a store clerk and the other is
a shopper, saying things like just
browsing or good deal. Another tip, slow
down and breathe. It's okay to pause and
think about what you want to say. In
fact, short pauses can make you sound
more natural. And here's a trick. Carry
a notebook or a notes app on your phone.
If you hear a phrase in this podcast,
jot it down and later try to say it in a
real situation. Over time, you'll build
confidence one phrase at a time. Also,
listen to English content you enjoy,
songs, podcasts, shows, and follow
along. If you're shy about speaking to
others, repeat lines from the show or
the news out loud to yourself. It's like
a private rehearsal. Great answers,
Emma. Maria, keep practicing and be
patient with yourself. Every phrase you
try is a win. You'll get there and we're
cheering for you.
All right, it's time for our vocabulary
and phrases recap. We'll take turns
going through some of the key
expressions from today's episode. And as
always, try repeating them with us out
loud. It's great practice.
Just browsing. A polite way to say I'm
just looking in a shop. Good deal.
Bargain. Something sold at a really low
price. That jacket is on sale. What a
bargain. Try it on. To check if clothes
fit, you try them on in the fitting
room. Miss the bus. To arrive late and
the bus leaves without you. I miss the
bus by 1 minute. Heavy traffic. When the
roads are full of cars causing delays.
Hang out. Chill out. Hang out means to
spend time with friends. Chill out means
to relax. Take up a hobby, to start
something new. I took up painting this
year.
Wind down. To relax after a busy day. I
like to wind down with music.
Download an app. To get a program onto
your phone. I downloaded a language app
yesterday.
Stream a movie or song. To play media
directly from the internet without
downloading it. Spill the beans. An
idiom meaning to accidentally reveal a
secret. I'm starving. Or I could eat a
horse. A funny idiom meaning I'm very
hungry. There were lots more today, but
these are some of the big ones.
Try using two or three of them in your
conversations this week or even in a
short writing exercise. And now it's
time for your final challenge.
All right, it's time for your mini
speaking challenge. This is where you
get to speak and practice using the
phrases we've covered today. That's
right. You don't need a partner or
perfect grammar, just a little courage
and your voice. Say it out loud and
don't worry about mistakes. Shopping
prompt. Imagine you're in a store
looking for something to buy. Maybe it's
clothes or maybe it's electronics.
Practice saying things like, "I'm just
browsing." Or, "Wow, that's a good
deal." Or, "Can I try this on?"
You can also describe something that's
out of stock or ask a salesperson for
another size. Daily plans prompt. Think
about your upcoming weekend. What are
you planning to do? Say it out loud like
you're talking to a friend. Use phrases
like, "I'm going to hang out with my
friends. I just want to chill out at
home." Or, "I need to wind down after a
long week." Make it your own. Include a
hobby or favorite way to relax. Travel
prompt. Now, imagine you're talking
about your daily commute or how you
travel. Use real life phrases like, "I
missed the bus this morning." "There was
heavy traffic on the way." Or, "I
usually carpool with my coworker." You
could even mention using an app to check
the schedule or plugging in your phone
during the ride. Remember, this isn't
about saying it perfectly. It's about
speaking, even if it's just to yourself.
So, here's what to do. Pause the
episode, pick one of the prompts, and
talk for a minute or two out loud. You
can record yourself, look in a mirror,
or write a quick script and act it out.
Go ahead, pause now and try it. When
you're ready, hit play again, and we'll
be here. Welcome back. We hope you gave
it a go. And if not, it's never too
late. You can always rewind and try
again later. That's the beauty of
practice. Small steps every day really
do add up.
Great job, everyone. We really hope you
enjoyed learning and practicing all
these everyday English phrases with us
today. Yeah, you've made it through
shopping conversations, travel talk,
hobbies, tech, and even one of my
embarrassing mistakes. That's a solid
day of English learning. Totally. And
remember, the key is to practice a
little each day. Even 5 minutes of
speaking or reviewing makes a big
difference. Don't be afraid to use the
phrases in real life, either. Whether
you're texting a friend, ordering food,
or commuting to work, try sneaking in a

Hello and welcome to English Phrases Hub
podcast. I'm Emma and I'm Jake. Hi
everyone. We're so excited to have you
join us today for English learning
conversation. This is the podcast where
we help beginner and intermediate
English learners improve their
conversational skills through fun real
life dialogues. Make yourself
comfortable. Grab a cup of tea or coffee
and let's chat in English. We've got a
great episode lined up today. We'll
cover everyday conversation topics like
travel, food, work, and daily life.
We'll also tackle some small talk tips.
You know, those little chats about the
weather, or what you did on the weekend.
And be sure to stick around because
later we have Jake's mistake where Jake
will confess a funny English mistake he
made. Oh no. Do we have to bring that
up?
Okay. Okay. It's pretty funny, I admit.
We'll also have Emma's tip, a quick
useful language tip from me, plus a
vocabulary recap at the end. And don't
forget our listener Q&A segment. We'll
answer a question from one of you about
learning English. There's a lot coming
up. By the way, we might mention some
British versus American English
differences as we go since I'm from the
UK and Jake here is from the US. Yep.
You've got a Brit and an American
teaming up to help you learn. Two
accents for the price of one. Exactly.
So, you'll hear both British and
American phrases. Don't worry, we'll
explain any differences so you won't get
confused. Sound good? All right, let's
get started with a little bit of small
talk. Ready, Emma? Ready? Let's jump in.
So, Emma, it's a beautiful day today,
isn't it? It is. The sun is shining and
I'm in a great mood. How are you doing
today, Jake? I'm doing well, thanks. I
got up early and went for a short run
this morning. How about you? I'm great.
I had a nice relaxed morning with a cup
of tea. By the way, listeners, notice
how we started with a bit of small talk
about the weather and how we are. This
is a very typical friendly way to start
a conversation in English, right?
Talking about the weather is a classic
small talk topic, especially in Britain.
Brits love talking about weather.
We certainly do. It's practically a
national pastime. Also, we greeted each
other. I said, "How are you doing?" And
Emma said, "I'm great." These are simple
introduction or greeting lines. You can
also say, "Hi, how are you?" or "How's
it going?" to start a chat. And since
some of you might be new here, let's
quickly introduce ourselves properly.
This is a great chance to practice
introductions. Jake, why don't you
introduce yourself like we've just met?
Sure.
Hi, I'm Jake. I'm from the United
States. I work as a software developer
by day and I'm also an English
enthusiast who loves learning languages.
In my free time, I enjoy traveling and
trying new foods. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too, Jake. I'm Emma
from the UK. I'm an English teacher and
a podcast host. I love helping people
learn English. In my spare time, I read
books and go hiking. It's a pleasure to
meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you,
too. That's a pretty typical
introduction exchange, isn't it? We
stated our names, where we're from, what
we do, and a hobby. Then finished with a
polite phrase. Exactly. Phrases like
nice to meet you or pleasure to meet you
are common when you meet someone for the
first time. And we should mention in the
US people often say hi, how are you as a
greeting even if it's the first time you
meet? The expected answer is usually
simple like good, thanks and you.
They're not literally asking for your
life story. Good point. In the UK, we
might say, "You all right?" as a casual
greeting. The first time I said, "You
all right?" to Jake, he looked a bit
confused.
I remember that. I thought you were
concerned if I was upset or something.
In the US, are you all right can sound
like you think something is wrong, but I
learned that you all right in British
English just means hello, how are you?
Exactly. So there's a little British
versus American quirk for you. You all
right in UK is the same as how are you
in US in casual settings. Learning these
cultural nuances helps you sound more
natural. Don't worry, no one will be mad
if you mix them up, but it's fun to
know. Definitely. So that was a bit
about greetings and introductions. Now
that we've gotten to know each other,
shall we move on to our first big topic?
Yes. Let's dive into talking about
travel, one of my favorite topics.
Speaking of travel, you mentioned you
enjoy traveling. Have you taken any
trips recently, Jake? I have. I just got
back from a holiday in Spain last month.
Oops, I should say vacation since I'm
American.
That's okay. In the UK, I'd call it a
holiday. In the US, you'd say vacation.
Brits also say holiday for time off
work, while Americans might say vacation
days. We understand both on this show,
right? So, I'll tell you about my trip.
I went to Barcelona for a week. It was
amazing. I booked my flight and hotel
online easily. To book means to reserve
in advance. Good use of the word book.
Listeners, to book something means to
reserve it, like booking a hotel or
booking a ticket. Barcelona was
incredible. I did all the touristy
things. I visited the Sigrada Familia,
walked along the beach, and ate tons of
local food. Tapas, paella. I was in food
heaven.
That sounds brilliant. Barcelona is a
beautiful city with great food. Did you
get a chance to practice any Spanish
while you were there? A little bit. Yes.
I tried to use basic Spanish greetings
and phrases, but since this is an
English podcast, I'll stick to English
now.
Fair enough. So, what was the highlight
of your trip? One highlight was taking a
scenic train ride along the coast. The
view of the sea was breathtaking. I
mean, it was so beautiful. It literally
took my breath away for a moment.
Breathtaking. Great word. It means
extremely beautiful or awe inspiring.
I'm glad you had a wonderful time. I
did. Oh, and a funny thing happened at
the hotel. I asked the receptionist
where the elevator was, but then I
quickly remembered to say lift for you
Brits.
They would have understood elevator,
too. But yes, lift is the British word.
British English, lift. American English,
elevator. I actually loved noticing
those differences. Another one. I told
some new friends I met, "I'm on
vacation." and they replied, "Oh, you're
on holiday." It clicked then, "Vacation
and holiday mean the same thing
depending on who you talk to." Exactly.
Little vocabulary differences like that
give English its character. We'll recap
some of those later. By the way,
traveling is such a great way to learn
new languages. I picked up a few Spanish
phrases and it also made me appreciate
how useful English is when you're
abroad. People spoke English at the
hotel and on tours, so it helped me get
around. English really is an
international travel language. And for
our listeners, even learning some basic
travel phrases in English, like how to
ask for directions, order food, or book
tickets can be super helpful. Maybe in a
future episode, we can do a role play at
an airport or something. Great idea. But
for now, I think our travel chat is
making me hungry. You mentioned food
heaven. Shall we talk about food next?
Yes, I'm always ready to talk about
food.
So, you tried tapos and paella in Spain.
Yum. What's your favorite food, Jake?
Honestly, I love pizza. It's simple, but
I could eat pizza every day. Also, I
have a sweet tooth, so I'm all about
desserts. Pizza is a solid choice, and
I'm with you on desserts. I can't resist
chocolate cake. The food in Spain was
great. One night, I went to a little
local restaurant. The menu was all in
Spanish, but thankfully the waiter
translated. I almost ordered something
weird by accident because I misread the
menu.
Oh no. Mystery dish for dinner. Yeah, I
thought I was ordering ice cream and it
turned out to be some kind of cold
octopus salad. I was like, "This is not
what I expected for dessert." Surprise.
Well, at least you tried something new.
How did you ask for the bill at the end?
Or should I say check since you're
American?
I actually said, "Could we have the
check, please?" The waiter understood.
Of course, in the UK, I know you'd say,
"Can we have the bill, please?" US
check. UK bill for paying at a
restaurant. That's right. And by the
way, could we have the bill, please? Or
can I get the check, please? are both
polite ways to ask for the total cost at
a restaurant. Food vocabulary can be
tricky between US and UK, too. For
example, I love French fries, but Emma
would call them chips. Yes. If I say
chips, I mean what Americans call fries.
And what I call crisps are what
Americans call chips, the thin, crunchy
ones from a bag. It's a bit confusing,
right? Chips versus fries versus crisps.
But don't worry, context usually makes
it clear. If I'm in London and see fish
and chips on a menu, I know it's fish
and French fries, not fish and potato
chips from a bag. Exactly. Context is
key. We usually figure it out and maybe
have a little laugh about it.
Speaking of laughs, I have a quick food
idiom for our listeners. Piece of cake.
If something is a piece of cake, it
means it's really easy. Like learning
English with Emma and Jake is a piece of
cake.
I hope our listeners feel that way.
Another one, have a lot on your plate.
It's not just about food. If you have a
lot on your plate, it means you're very
busy or have a lot of responsibilities.
Oh, that describes me last week at work
perfectly. I had so much on my plate.
Which reminds me, we should talk a bit
about work life and daily life for a
bit. Yes, good idea. Before we move on,
any final food thoughts? Maybe favorite
British foods? I tried fish and chips
when I visited London. Delicious. And I
learned to say biscuits for what we call
cookies in the US. Biscuits in the UK
are cookies in the US. Yes, but careful.
In the US, biscuits are a type of bread
roll, often eaten with gravy. Totally
different. True. Okay, I think we could
talk about food forever, but let's
switch gears to everyday work and daily
life for a bit. So, Jake, you mentioned
you're a software developer. How's work
going lately? It's going well. I've been
working from home mostly. I have a
flexible schedule, which is nice.
Sometimes I start early, other days I
work late. It depends on the project.
That's great. Many people are working
from home these days. It can save time
on the commute, the travel to and from
work. Definitely. I used to commute
nearly an hour every day, but now my
commute is just from my bedroom to my
living room. Lucky you. My commute is
about 30 minutes by train. Not too bad.
I often read a book or listen to
podcasts like this one on the way. Good
idea. Using commute time to learn. So,
what's a workday like for you, Emma?
Well, as an English teacher and podcast
host, I split my time. Some days I
prepare lessons or teach classes online,
and other days we record episodes or
plan new content for English phrases
hub. I also do a bit of writing for our
blog. It's a mix, but I enjoy it. Sounds
busy, but fun. Do you ever feel like you
have a lot on your plate? Call back to
idiom
sometimes. Yes. When I have many lessons
to plan at once, I definitely have a lot
on my plate. But I love my work, so I
can't complain. I hear you. By the way,
since we're talking about work, there's
a British versus American term, CV
versus resume. In the UK, you'd send a
CV when applying for a job, right? Yes.
In the UK, we talk about CVs, short for
curriculum vi for job applications. In
the US, people more often say resume for
the same thing. A summary of your work
experience. UK CV US resume. Exactly.
Little difference in wording. Same idea.
Also, you might hear job advert in the
UK and job posting in the US. Good one.
We could probably list many work-related
vocabulary differences, but again, most
people will understand you just fine if
you use either term, right? How about
daily life outside of work? What do you
do after work, Emma? After work, I
usually go to the gym or take a walk in
the park. Then I cook dinner. I might
watch a bit of TV or as we say in
Britain, telly in the evening. Finally,
I read a book before bed if I'm not too
tired. That sounds nice. Telly. I like
that word. Americans would just say TV.
My routine is a bit different. I often
work late, so I might order takeout.
Americans say takeout. Brits say take
away. If I don't have time to cook after
dinner, I play some video games or watch
YouTube. Then I try to get to bed by
around midnight. Takeaway, take out.
Another pair of vocab differences there.
Our listeners are getting a lot of these
today. Yes, you are. But don't worry,
we'll review some of them soon in our
vocab recap. Before that, I think it's
time for one of our favorite segments.
Jake, are you ready for Jake's Mistake?
I guess so. Let's do it.
All right, everyone. It's time for
Jake's mistake. This is the part of the
show where Jake shares a funny English
mistake he's made so we can all learn
from it. What do you have for us today,
Jake? Okay, so this one is embarrassing
but funny. It happened when I first
moved to England for a year of study. On
my first day at university in London, a
classmate came up to me and said, "You
all right." Seems friendly enough. You
all right? Is a very common British
greeting. Right. But I didn't know that
yet. I was confused. I thought he was
asking if something was wrong with me,
like if I looked ill or upset. So, I
answered, "Yeah, I'm okay. Am I not
looking all right? I must have looked
totally puzzled.
Oh no, I can imagine his face. He was
the one who looked confused then. He
probably thought I was weird. He said,
"Mate, it just means hello. How are
you?" And we both laughed when I
realized it was just a greeting. That is
a classic mixup for Americans in the UK.
You all right? Sounds like are you okay
to an American, but in British slang, it
just means hi. Exactly. We eventually
became good friends, and he never let me
live that down. Every morning, he'd
greet me with, "You all right, Jake?"
with a grin.
Well, you learned fast. And now our
listeners know it, too. If a Brit says,
"You all right?" they're likely not
actually worried about you. It's just
hello. Another quick one. I also once
made a mistake ordering food because of
a word difference. In the US, pants are
what you wear on your legs. In the UK,
pants can mean underwear,
and they use trousers for the outerwear.
Oh dear. Did that cause confusion? A
little. I was at a pub and it was warm
inside. So, I said, "It's hot in here. I
might take off my pants."
My British friend gave me a shocked look
and said, "Maybe not here, mate. I meant
my heavy jeans, but he thought I was
talking about removing my underwear.
Note to everyone, trousers UK equals
pants US. If you say pants in the UK,
people might think you mean
undergarments.
That was definitely a memorable mistake.
Thanks for sharing, Jake. Mistakes like
that are hilarious in hindsight and
honestly one of the best ways to learn.
Don't be afraid to make mistakes,
listeners. Even native speakers get
confused by different dialects.
Absolutely. If you mess up, just laugh
it off and remember for next time. And
now that we've all had a good laugh,
it's time for our next segment. Ready
for Emma's tip? Sure, let's do it.
This is Emma's tip where Emma gives us a
quick handy tip for learning English.
What's our tip of the day, Emma? Thanks,
Jake. My tip today is about practicing
speaking when you're alone. A lot of
learners ask, "How can I practice
speaking if I have no one to talk to?"
Here's a great trick. Think in English.
Think in English. How does that help? It
helps you stop translating from your
native language. For example, when
you're going about your day, narrate it
in your mind in English. If you're
brushing your teeth, think I am brushing
my teeth. If you see a tree outside,
think that tree is very tall.
Interesting. So, you make simple
sentences in your head about what you
see and do. Exactly. You can also talk
to yourself when no one's around if you
feel shy. Describe what you're doing.
I'm cooking pasta for dinner. I need to
boil the water first. It might feel
silly, but it builds your confidence in
using English words in real time. I do
that sometimes, actually. I narrate my
actions in English when I'm practicing a
new language or I pretend I'm explaining
my day to someone in English. It really
works. Another part of the tip, if you
learn a new word or phrase, use it right
away. Try to make your own sentence with
it, either out loud or in writing. The
sooner you use a new word, the better
you remember it. Great advice. So, think
in English and talk to yourself to
practice speaking. I love it. And no
partner needed. Exactly. It's a simple
habit you can do anywhere. Consistency
is key. Even a few minutes a day of this
can help. Awesome. I hope you all try
that at home. Now, speaking of learners
asking questions like that, shall we
answer a listener's question? Yes, it's
time for our listener Q&A.
Today's question comes from a fictional
listener named Carlos in Brazil. We're
using a madeup name in place, but the
question is one we actually hear a lot.
Carlos asks, "I'm shy and I find it hard
to make small talk in English. How can I
get better at everyday conversations?"
Great question, Carlos. Many learners
feel shy or nervous about small talk,
especially in a second language. I have
a couple of suggestions. Go for it,
Emma. First, prepare some common small
talk topics and questions. For example,
you know, people often chat about the
weather, hobbies, or weekend plans. So,
have a few simple questions ready, like,
"What do you do for fun?" or "Did you
watch anything good on TV recently?"
Also, be ready to answer these yourself.
Practicing your answers in advance can
help you feel more confident. Good idea.
If you have a few go-to questions, you
won't feel as panicky about thinking of
something to say. Second, try to find
opportunities to practice in a low
pressure environment. If you're in an
English class or have an online language
partner, practice small talk at the
start of each session. Even talking to
yourself in the mirror as if you're
chatting with someone can help, as funny
as that sounds. Also, don't worry about
making mistakes or sounding perfect. The
point of small talk is just to break the
ice and be friendly. Most native
speakers are friendly and will carry the
conversation if you show you're
interested. Exactly. Showing enthusiasm
can go a long way. Simple things like
smiling if in person and saying that's
interesting or I'd love to hear more
about that encourage the other person to
keep talking and takes pressure off you
to lead the conversation. That's a great
tip. People love when you show interest.
Even just listening actively and nodding
or saying uh-huh helps. Finally, expose
yourself to a lot of casual English like
you're doing now with this podcast. The
more you listen to natural
conversations, the more phrases and
fillers you'll pick up like by the way,
you know, actually, etc., you'll start
to feel what's natural to say. So, in
summary, prepare some topics, practice
often, even in low pressure ways. Don't
be too hard on yourself, and listen to
real conversations to absorb phrases.
Yes, over time those everyday
conversations will become well a piece
of cake. We hope that answers your
question, Carlos, and hopefully our
listeners found that useful, too. If you
have a question, feel free to send it to
us. We might feature it in a future
episode. Absolutely. We love hearing
from you. Now, before we end, let's
review some of the vocabulary and
phrases we used today.
We covered a lot of useful words and
phrases. Let's recap a few of them.
Listen up and see if you remember these.
Holiday, UK. Vocation, US. Time off from
work or school or a trip for fun. I'm
going on holiday to Spain means the same

an appointment or ticket. I booked a
hotel room. I reserved it in advance.
Scenic having beautiful scenery. We took
the scenic route through the mountains.
Breathtaking. Extremely beautiful or
amazing. Literally so beautiful it takes
your breath away. The view from the top
of the hill was breathtaking.
Bill, UK, check, US. The list of charges
you pay at a restaurant. Could we have
the bill, please? Or can I get the
check, please?
Chips, UK. Fries, US. Fried potato
sticks. Fish and chips in the UK is fish

order from a restaurant to eat at home.
Shall we get Indian takeaway tonight?
You all right? UK casual greeting
meaning hello. How are you? It doesn't
literally mean asking if you are okay.
Piece of cake. Idiom something very easy
to do. The test was a piece of cake.
There were more, but these are some key
ones to remember. If any of these are
new for you, try writing them down and
using them in your own sentences later.
And remember Emma's tip. Try to think in
English and use these new phrases in
your thoughts or speech today. That will
really help reinforce them.
All right, now it's challenge time. We
like to end with a mini practice
challenge for you. Today's challenge.
Introduce yourself in English for one
minute. Imagine you've just met someone
new or you're meeting us. Say your name,
where you're from, what you do, and one
of your hobbies or favorite things. You
can do this in front of a mirror, or
even record yourself on your phone. Yes,
give it a try. For example, you heard
how Emma and I introduced ourselves
earlier. Now it's your turn. If you're a
bit shy, remember it's just you there.
No pressure. If you want extra practice,
you could also leave a short
introduction in the comments if you're
listening on YouTube. We love to read
about you, and it's good writing
practice, too. And of course, you can
relisten to this episode to shadow our
conversations or repeat the phrases out
loud after us. That's another great way
to practice speaking. We hope you
enjoyed today's episode. We certainly
had fun chatting. Definitely, we covered
a lot. Travel, food, daily life, idioms,
you name it. Thank you for joining us
for this English learning conversation.
Remember, the key is to practice a
little every day and not be afraid of
mistakes. You've got this. We're here to
help you on your English journey. If you
found this episode helpful, give it a
thumbs up and subscribe to our channel
so you won't miss the next one. Until
then, take care and keep practicing. Bye
for now. Bye-bye. See you next time.
[Music]
Okay. So, picture this. You finally made
it. That dream destination. Maybe it's
uh Tokyo, maybe Rome, maybe Marc, right?
Somewhere amazing. Exactly. The sights,
the sounds. It's incredible. But then
that moment hits. You need to actually
get somewhere. Oh, the logistics tick in
and bam. Yeah. that little flicker of
panic that uhoh failing starts because
well the language barrier around just
catching a bus or finding a taxi it
suddenly feels massive like a wall. It's
a completely valid feeling. Honestly, it
stops so many people from really diving
in when they travel. Navigating
transport systems in another language,
it can be genuinely intimidating. It
absolutely is and you are definitely not
alone if you feel that. We were digging
into the source material for this. It's
a guide specifically on English for
travel transportation and wow, what did
it say? It highlighted this Promova
study. Yeah. A full third of American
travelers get anxious about language
barriers abroad. A third. And get this,
for Gen Z travelers, that number jumps
to over 50%. More than half. That level
of anxiety, it's just a huge barrier,
isn't it, to really experiencing things.
It really is. And what this source
material does so well, I think, is it
takes that big scary problem and, you
know, breaks it down into manageable
chunks, right? It's not saying you need
to become fluent overnight. It's about
having a targeted practical toolkit for
those specific moments. Airports, train
stations, taxis. Exactly. So, our
mission really in this deep dive is to
pull out the most important stuff from
the source, the vocabulary, the key
phrases, the tips, basically the things
that build confidence. So, you can swap
that feeling of dread for hopefully some
actual excitement about getting around.
Precisely. By the time we're done, we
want you to feel like you've got the
keys. Yeah. to unlock any city's
transport system. Let's do it. So, the
source starts very logically with the
absolute foundations, the building
blocks, which are the core verbs you
need to even talk about moving around,
and then those essential questions for
when you just need help, right? These
are like your workh horses
linguistically speaking. The source
really hammers home getting comfortable
with these first. Yeah. So, key verbs of
motion, the most obvious one is to go.
Can't get much more basic than that. And
it's incredibly versatile. You can use
it for almost anything. I need to go to
the airport. Does this train go
downtown? Simple, direct. It just works.
Okay, go. Got it. What else? Then you've
got to travel. The source uses this a
bit more generally, maybe for longer
distances. I love to travel by train or,
you know, we're traveling through three
countries. Makes sense. More about the
overall journey. And then verbs that are
more specific to the how, like to drive,
if you're the one controlling the car or
the bus driver drives the bus. Okay. and
to ride. That's common for things like
bicycles, motorbikes, sometimes even
being a passenger, like riding a horse
or you can say riding the bus, though
often people just use to take. I was
just thinking that. Exactly. That's the
next one. And the source really
highlights it as kind of an MVP. A most
valuable player. MVP verb. I like it.
Yeah, because you can take almost any
kind of transport. It's a fantastic
shortcut. I'll take a taxi. Let's take
the subway. Did you take the ferry? So,
if you blank on the specific verb, take
is usually a safe bet. Often, yes. It's
incredibly flexible. Really handy. Good
tip. Okay, so we can go, travel, drive,
ride, take. What about planes and boats,
right? The obvious ones. To fly for
planes, to sail for boats and ships.
Okay. And physically getting on and off
these things. Good point. The source
gives us to get on and to board. Board
is a bit more formal. Well, you hear it
a lot for planes and ships. Boarding the
aircraft now. Exactly. And the opposites
are to get off and too light. A light is
quite formal, though. You might see it
written on a sign, but you probably
wouldn't say it. So, get on the bus,
board the plane, get off at the next
stop. Makes sense. Yeah. And for things
on a schedule, like trains or buses, two
crucial ones, to catch, meaning you're
on time for it. We need to hurry to
catch the train, right? And the
opposite, which you really don't want to
miss. Oh no, we missed the last bus.
Been there, haven't we all? So, okay,
you have these action words. How does
the source suggest using them with
questions? It boils it down to a few
essentials and the golden rule number
one according to the source. Always
always start with excuse me, the
universal polite opener. Absolutely.
Gets attention without being rude. After
that, the most basic question is where
is simple direct for finding a place?
Where is the bus stop? Where is platform
3? Okay. And if you need a bit more than
just the location, like how to actually
get there, then you use how do I get to
this ask for the method or the route.
How do I get to the National Museum? It
implies you need directions or advice on
which bus or train to take. Gotcha. And
for just general help, you can always
fall back on, can you help me, please?
simple and effective. Or if you're
already on your way but feeling unsure,
is this the right way to it or is this
the right bus for the zoo? Good
confirmation questions. And inevitably,
you'll need to ask about money. How much
is a ticket to? Ah, yes, the cost. And
the source adds a little note here. The
UK US difference. A return ticket in the
UK is what Americans call a roundtrip
ticket. Oh, that's a handy one to know.
Avoids confusion. Definitely. So, you
can combine these easily. Excuse me,
where can I catch the bus to the market?
Excuse me, how do I get to the nearest
subway station? And the source's big tip
for all of this basic interaction, speak
slowly and clearly. Don't worry about
your accent. It's fine. Simple sentences
are best. And remember, the person
you're asking might also be using
English as a second language. So,
clarity helps everyone. Good point. Keep
it simple. Exactly. And they also
mention a few other UKs word pairs to be
aware of besides tickets, like transport
versus transportation. Right. Brit say
transport and lororry versus truck or
underground or tube in London versus
subway in the US. Just knowing these
exist helps. Okay, that's a really solid
foundation. Essential verbs and
questions. Now, let's venture into
arguably the most complex transport
hub, the airport. The airport. Yeah. The
source points out that flying is how
most international trips start, right?
So getting the airport English down is
pretty crucial. It can feel
overwhelming. All those signs,
announcements, different counters. It's
the sheer volume of specific
terminology. I think so. What are the
absolute
mustnos the source pulls out for
surviving the airport? Okay, they start
with the core stuff about your actual
journey. Airline, flight, ticket, or
more likely now, e ticket, right? Your
digital ticket and everything about your
bags, baggage or luggage, same thing.
But specifically, checked baggage, the
ones that go underneath in the hold.
Exactly. And carry-on baggage or hand
luggage, the bags you keep with you. And
related to that, your baggage allowance.
How much weight or how many bags you're
allowed. Okay. Then you get there, you
need to check in. Usually at the
check-in counter. That's where you show
your passport and ticket, drop off your
check bags, and get your boarding pass.
Magic ticket to get on the plane. Yeah.
The fun part. Ah, yes. Security check or
security screening. taking laptops out,
liquids and bags, the whole drill. Then
you follow the signs for departures if
you're leaving or arrivals if you're
well arriving. You need to find your
gate number listed on your boarding pass
and the departure screens and pay
attention to the boarding time. Big
airports might have different terminals,
so check that, too. And when you land,
you usually go through passport control
or immigration first. Then you collect
your bags, and then you go through
customs, right? Immigration checks you,
customs checks your stuff, basically.
And hopefully your stuff is waiting for
you at baggage claim on the baggage
carousel. You'll often need your flight
number to know which carousel. Flight
number is key. You need it everywhere.
It really is. And keeping an eye on the
departure boards for those important
status updates on time, fingers crossed,
or the dreaded delayed or canceled.
Okay. And on the plane itself, a couple
of key terms. Yeah. You put your
carry-on in the overhead bin or overhead
locker and if you need the toilet, you
ask for the lavatory. Lavatory. Got it.
Posh word for toilet. Okay. So, that's
the vocabulary. How does the source
suggest actually using it like in those
many conversations you have, they break
it down by location. So, at check-in,
you'd approach the counter and say
something like, "Hi, I'd like to check
in for my flight to London." Have your
documents ready? Definitely. Here's my
passport and e ticket. The agent will
probably ask, "How many bags are you
checking in?" You might want to ask for
a specific seat. Could I have a window
seat, please? Or an aisle seat. And
they'll give you your boarding pass and
tell you the gate in time. Exactly. Then
going through security, it feels
intense, but the officers usually give
clear instructions like laptops out.
Yeah. Place your bags on the belt, take
off shoes, belts, jackets, remove
electronics, any liquids. You might need
to ask a question yourself like, "Do I
need to take my tablet out, too?" Good
question. Okay. Survive security. Now
you're at the gate. Listen for
announcements. They'll say when boarding
starts, often by zones or rows. If
you're unsure, just ask the gate agent.
Excuse me, is this the correct gate for
flight
BA213? Or if you miss something, sorry,
what did that announcement say? Always
okay to ask. On the plane itself, flight
attendants will greet you. Welcome
aboard. You might need help finding your
seat. Could you help me find my seat,
please? Simple requests are fine. Could
I have a blanket or could I have some
water? Pay attention to safety briefings
and announcements about turbulence and
landing times. And yes, knowing how to
ask for the lavatory, right? Okay, we've
landed. Immigration and customs. What
are the key interactions there? Be
prepared for standard questions from the
immigration officer. Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit?
Tourism, business, right? How long will
you be staying? Give a clear answer. For
2 weeks, for 10 days, where will you be
staying? Have your hotel name ready at
the Grand Hotel. And customs might ask,
"Do you have anything to declare?"
Assuming you don't have restricted goods
or too much cash, the answer is usually
nothing to declare. Keep answers simple,
direct, and truthful. Okay, last hurdle.
Baggage claim. Look for the screens
showing which carousel has the bags for
your flight number. If you can't see it,
ask staff. Excuse me, which carousel is
the baggage for flight number number?
And if the worst happens, your bag
doesn't show up. Don't panic. Find the
baggage services desk or sometimes it's
called lost and found. Go there and say,
"My luggage hasn't arrived on flight
number. I need to report lost luggage."
Have your baggage claim sticker handy.
Okay, so the source boils down the key
airport phrases, too. Things like,
"Where is the check-in counter for
airline?" "What gate is my flight to
city? Is my flight on time delayed
canceled? And where is the baggage claim
for flight number?" And a big overall
tip for airports, remember that
international airports have tons of
signs, often in English. Staff deal with
travelers from all over the world every
day. They're used to helping, so don't
be afraid to ask, even if you have to
point. Good
advice. Okay, airport conquered. Now,
let's hit the streets. Taxis, ride
shares, maybe renting a car, right?
These give you more flexibility. Maybe
door-to-door service. The source covers
all three. taxis or cabs, ride shares
like Uber and rental cars. Let's start
with taxis. How do you even get one? You
might find a designated taxi rank.
That's common UK English. Or a taxi
stand, more US. Or you can just hail one
on the street in many places. And
phrases for finding one. Simple ones
like, "Excuse me, where can I find a
taxi?" Or, "Is there a taxi rank near
here?" Okay, you've got one, you get in.
What next? The driver will probably ask
where to. The key phrase the source
gives is, "Could you take me to a dress
or a landmark, please?" It's polite and
clear. Good idea to have the address
written down, too, right? You can just
show it to them. If you have bags, you
can ask, "Could you help me with my bags
for the boot, please?" Or trunk in the
US. Boot trunk. Good one. What about
during the ride? Fairs, directions.
Important to clarify the fair if
possible. You can ask, "Could you please
use the meter?" Or maybe, "How much will
it be to destination approximately?"
Just to get an idea. And if they're
driving like a maniac, a polite, could
you please slow down a little might work
to get out? Could you stop here, please?
Bang up. The driver will state the fair.
It's smart to ask before the ride starts
or when you get in, do you accept credit
cards? Save hassle later. Always good to
ask for a receipt. Could I have a
receipt, please? And tipping. The source
just notes that tipping customs vary
hugely around the world, so maybe do a
quick search for your destination
beforehand. Good point. Okay. What about
ride shares? Uber, Lift, that kind of
thing. Here, most of the communication
is through the app, which is easier.
Booking, destination, payment, it's all
digital. True, but there's still that
moment of finding the right car, right?
The key phrase the source gives for that
is confirming with the driver. Are you
driver's name for your name? No. Just to
make sure you're not hopping into a
random car. Smart. And payment is
usually automatic. So, that's one less
thing to worry about. Okay. Then there's
the ultimate
freedom, renting a car. Maximum
flexibility, but also maybe the most
complex interaction. The source strongly
suggests booking online in advance.
Makes sense. So, you get to the rental
desk. You'd say, "Hi, I have a
reservation under the name, your name,
or if you haven't booked, I'd like to
rent a car, please. Be ready with your
driving license, UK, or driver's
license, US, and usually your passport,
too." They'll ask what kind of car you
want. Yep. You'll need to know the type
of car you need, compact, sedan or
saloon in the UK, SUV, etc. And
crucially, the
transmission, automatic or manual, also
called stick shift. Most tourists prefer
automatic if they're not used to manual.
Definitely easier if you're driving on
the wrong side of the road. What about
insurance? Ah, insurance. The source
says this is important. There will be
options like collision damage waiver,
CDW. Don't just tick the box. Ask what
exactly does this insurance cover? Good
advice. What else to clarify? The rental
period, dates and times, pickup and drop
off locations, sometimes different. Key
questions to ask. What's the daily rate
or the weekly rate? Are there any
additional charges I should know about
like mileage limits? Exactly. Does it
have GPS? Does it have air conditioning?
Is there a mileage limit? And very
important, what type of fuel does it
use? Is it petrol? UK or gas, gasoline,
US. Diesel. Putting the wrong fuel in is
a disaster. Big time. Also ask, "Do I
need to return it with a full tank?"
Usually, yes. Okay, you've got the keys
before you drive off. Crucial step. Walk
around the car. Check for any existing
scratches or dents. Make sure they're
noted on your rental agreement before
you leave. Saves arguments later. Smart.
And maybe ask for a quick orientation if
you're unfamiliar with the model. Could
you show me how the lights work? Where
are the wipers? How do I open the bonnet
hood or the boot trunk? Bonnet hood.
Boot trunk. More UKS pairs. Yep. The
source includes a little cheat sheet for
road terms, too, like motorway UK versus
freeway US. Dual carriageway versus
divided highway, roundabout versus
traffic circle, diversion versus detour,
car park versus parking lot, pavement
UK, sidewalk versus sidewalk, US, curb
versus curb, indicator versus blinker.
Knowing these helps understand road
signs and directions, even if you're not
driving, that's really useful. So, the
source's key takeaways for car travel.
The main phrases are things like, "Could
you take me to address for taxis? Are
you driver's name for my name for ride
shares?" And I'd like to rent an
automatic car for a week for rentals.
And the general tip, be polite. Always
confirm details like fairs or rental
terms. And don't hesitate to ask
questions if you're unsure about
anything, especially with a rental car.
Makes sense. Okay, that covers cars.
Now, for what's often the cheapest, most
local way to get around cities, public
transport, buses, trains, subways,
right? The source calls this navigating
the grid and it definitely has its own
language. So instead set of terms you
need to know like a map legend for the
system. Exactly. You need to know where
to cache things. Bus stop, train station
or railway station in the UK. Sometimes
railroad station in the US, subway
station, which might also be called
metro tube in London or underground. And
inside the station you wait on the
platform for trains, though in the US
they often say track number. Okay. And
you need a ticket. You need a ticket. Is
it a single or one-way ticket or a
return or roundtrip ticket? The cost is
the fair. You'll want to check the timet
UK or schedule US to see when things run
and the road itself. Each bus or train
line follows a route or a line.
Definitely grab a map of the system if
you can. Where do you buy these tickets?
Either at a ticket machine or vending
machine or from a person at a ticket
office, sometimes called a booking
office. And watch out for the tech
inspector or conductor who might come
around to check your ticket. In the US,
if you change lines, you might need a
transfer ticket. And know if you're
getting on a local service, stops
everywhere. Or an express, faster, fewer
stops. Okay, let's break it down. Buses
first. How do you navigate those? At the
bus stop, if you're unsure, you can ask
other people waiting. Excuse me, does
this bus go to the museum? Or ask the
driver as you get on, does this bus stop
at Elm Street? Paying the fair. If you
pay the driver directly, you'd say, "A
ticket to destination, please." Or ask,
"How much is the fair to?" Listen for
the driver saying, "Fairs, please." But
the source notes, "Many cities now use
travel cards you preload with money."
Like an Oyster card in London or a metro
card in New York. Exactly. On the bus
itself, you might ask someone, "Is this
seat taken?" Listen for automated
announcements like, "Next stop, Central
Station. Press the stop button before
your stop and say, "Excuse me, please."
if you need to squeeze past people to
get off. Okay. Trains and subways, Metro
tubes, similar process. Similar, but
often starts with finding the right
platform or track. Look at the departure
boards. They list the destination,
departure time, and platform track
number. If the board is confusing, ask
station staff, excuse me, which platform
is the train to Oxford. And it's always
good to double check it's the right
train. Does this train stop at Reading?
Remember, the UK usually says at
platform 2, while the US often says on
track two. Little differences. Buying
tickets. Ticket machines are common. The
source highlights that most have an
English language option. Look for a flag
icon or the word English. What are the
typical steps on a machine? Usually,
select language. Choose your
destination. Choose the ticket type.
Single return. Select the number of
tickets. Confirm just pay card or cash.
And at a tricket office, you'd say, "I'd
like a ticket to destination, please."
Specify if you want single or return,
and how many tickets? You can also ask,
"When is the next train or is it a
direct train or do I need to change
train?" Ah, good questions. What about
being on the train? Listen for
announcements. Next station, Piccadilly
Circus. This train is for Heathrow
Airport. And that classic London
Underground warning, please mind the gap
between the train and the platform.
Can't forget that one. You might ask
someone, "Is this seat free?" Look out
for reserved seats. US conductors might
shout all aboard before leaving. UK
guards might say, "Take your seats or
all change when the train reaches its
final destination." Okay, so the source
summarizes the key public transport
questions as things like, "Where can I
buy a ticket?" "How often do the bus
trains run? What time is the last train
tonight? Is there a map of the subway
system? Excuse me, I think I'm lost. Can
you help? Which line do I need for the
Eiffel Tower? And the overall tip for
mastering public transport, study the
maps beforehand if you can. Listen
carefully to announcements. And
seriously, don't hesitate to ask staff
or even other passengers for help. Most
people are willing to point you in the
right direction. Right. Okay. We've
covered the big ones, airports, cars,
public transport grids, but the source
also touches on some other ways you
might get around. Yeah. Expanding the
toolkit a bit. They cover things like
fairies for crossing water rivers, lakes
between islands. You'd go to a ferry
terminal for that. Exactly. Key phrases
would be, "Where can I catch the ferry
to the island?" "How much is a ticket?"
"What time is the next ferry?" "How long
does the crossing take?" Maybe, "Is
there a car ferry if you're driving?" Or
maybe, "Does the ferry have an
observation deck if you want views?"
Good one. And hopefully you won't need
it, but where are the life jackets? Good
to know. What else? Boats. Boat is more
general maybe for a sightseeing tour.
Are there boat tours of the harbor or
renting a small boat? How much is it to
rent a boat? Ship usually means a larger
vessel like a cruise ship. You talk
about the port or the dock. Okay. What
about on land but not cars or buses? The
source mentions bicycle or bike rentals
which are popular in many cities now.
Good way to see things. Definitely.
You'd need vocabulary like bike lane or
cycle lane in the UK. Helmet lock at the
rental shop. I'd like to rent a bicycle
for the day. Ask about the cost per hour
day, if a lock and helmet are included,
and where to return it. Motorcycles,
motorbikes, scooters. Similar rental
process, but the source notes you should
definitely ask about license
requirements and insurance. Good point.
What about trams? Tram common in Ukurup
or street car, more US. Those run on
rails in the street. Communication is
much like buses. Does this tram go to
the city center? Where do I buy a
ticket? And monails. You see those
sometimes? Yeah, often at airports,
theme parks or in some modern cities.
It's basically a train on a single rail.
So phrases are similar to train subways.
Where is the Montreal station? How much
is a ticket? Now, what about those
little three- wheeled things you see
everywhere in Asia? Ah, the rickshaw or
tuktuk auto rickshaw is motorized or
cycle rickshaws pedal powered. The
source has a really important tip for
these which is price negotiation is
usually expected and you must agree on
the price before you get in. Ah, the
golden rule of tuk tuk. Absolutely. The
key phrase is how much to go to
destination. Settle on a price first,
then you can say, "Okay, could you take
me to the grand palace?" idol tip. Any
others? Cable cars. Cable cars. Yeah.
For steep hills or mountains, simple
phoices. Where can I get the cable car
up the mountain? How much is a ride? So,
for all these slightly less common
modes, what's the main takeaway? The
source says the basic principles still
apply. State your destination clearly.
Ask the cost beforehand if you can,
especially if it's not fixed. Confirm
times. Be polite. And pointing at a map
or a picture of your destination is a
universal helper. Makes sense. Okay,
speaking of maps, even if you master the
transport, you'll probably still need to
ask for directions when you're just
walking around. Oh, inevitably. The
source has a whole section on asking for
directions like a local or at least
understanding them because getting lost
can be fun, but sometimes you just need
to find the bathroom. Exactly. Or your
hotel. And again, it starts with
politeness. Let me guess. Excuse me. You
got it. The universal opener. The source
suggests variations, too, like, "Excuse
me, can you help me, please? Could you
tell me the way to, "Oh, I'm looking for
place." Or even a very polite, "Sorry to
bother you, but okay, you've got their
attention. What are the best phrases for
the actual question?" Core ones are,
"How do I get to? Where is the nearest?
Could you tell me how to get to? What's
the best way to get to?" or confirming
is this the right way for and super
useful can you show me on the map asking
is one thing understanding the answer
that's the tricky part totally the
source points out that people often use
simple commands when giving directions
you need to listen for those key words
like basic direction words go straight
or go straight ahead or continue
straight on turn left or turn right
sometimes take a left right or make a
left right okay straight left right also
go past something meaning walk beyond
it. Okay? Cross the road or cross a
bridge, go along the street, go through
the park or through a tunnel. And people
use landmarks, right? Hugely important.
Listen for landmarks or points of
reference. Things like traffic lights or
stop light in the US. Crossroads UK or
intersection US, a roundabout or a
traffic circle, a street corner or
specific places. Yeah. Go past the big
red building. It's next to the shop
store, opposite the bank, behind the
post office near the church. Go through
the park. Cross the bridge. Walk along
the river in the main square. You can't
miss the monument. Those really help
anchor the directions. What about
positioning words? Prepositions of
place. Crucial things like on your left,
on your right, next to the pharmacy,
beside the cafe, between the bank and
the library, opposite the station,
across from the park, in front of the
museum, behind the church, near the
river, close to the bridge, at the end
of the road, over the bridge, under the
railway tracks. Wow. Okay. Lots to
listen for. And they'll often give you
an idea of distance or time. It's about
a 10-minute walk. It's not far from
here. It's quite far. Maybe take the
bus. It's about 500 meters that way. Go
two blocks common in US cities. Or take
the second right turn. So, putting it
all together, the source gives an
example dialogue. Yeah. Imagine you ask,
"Excuse me, how do I get to the city art
gallery?" The local might say, "Go
straight ahead on the street until you
see the park on your left. Go past the
park. Then, at the traffic lights, turn
right. Go along that street and the
galleries on your right. It's opposite a
big fountain about 10 minutes walk.
Okay, that combines a lot of those
elements. But what if they say it's
super fast or you just don't understand?
It's easy to just nod and pretend. Don't
do that. The source stresses it's
absolutely okay to ask for
clarification. Use phrases like, "Sorry,
I didn't quite understand. Could you say
that again, please?" Or, "Could you
speak a little slower?" Or ask about a
specific word. Definitely. Sorry, what
does roundabout mean? Mhm. And a great
technique is to repeat back what you
think they said to check. Okay. So, I go
straight, then turn right at the park,
and it's opposite a fountain. That
confirmation is smart. Prevents walking
miles in the wrong direction. Exactly.
And if you're walking along and start to
feel unsure again, just ask someone
else, "Excuse me, is this the right way
for the art gallery or am I going in the
right direction?" What are the sourc's
main tips for success with directions?
Listen for those key words. Straight
left, right, landmarks. Use your map
visually. Point if it helps. Watch
people's hand gestures they often point.
And always say thank you. Most people
are genuinely happy to help someone
who's lost. That's reassuring. Okay, so
we're armed with phrases for planned
travel and asking directions, but travel
isn't always smooth sailing, is it? What
about when things go wrong? Ah, yes, the
unexpected. Delays, lost luggage,
emergencies. The source covers handling
these curve balls, too. Being prepared
helps you stay calm. Let's start with
the common one. Delays and
cancellations, especially flights or
trains, right? Key vocabulary here.
Delayed, cancelled, gate change, rebook,
refund, compensation. So, you're staring
at the departure board and your flight
is delayed. What do you do? Go to the
airline desk or information counter.
Ask, "My flight to city seems delayed.
Do you know for how long?" It says
canceled. The board says my flight is
canceled. What are my options? Good
direct questions. What else might you
need to ask? Do I need to rebook my
ticket? Can I get a refund? Is there
another flight or train going today? If
it's a long delay, especially overnight,
ask, "Will the airline provide
accommodation?" You could also ask,
"What's the reason for the delay
cancellation?" And listen for
announcements, presumably. Definitely.
They'll usually announce updates over
the PA system using phrases like delayed
by approximately 2 hours or we apologize
for the inconvenience. Okay. Another
common nightmare, lost or damaged
luggage. Yes. If your bag doesn't appear
on the carousel, head straight for the
baggage services or lost and found desk
for your airline. What did you say? My
luggage hasn't arrived on flight number.
Or, I'd like to report my lost luggage.
If it did arrive, but it's broken. My
suitcase is damaged. Here's my baggage
claim tag. What will they ask you? to
describe the bag. Color, size, type,
brand, your flight number, where you
flew from, and your contact details, and
where you're staying locally, and what
should you ask them? Good questions are,
"How long does it usually take to find
lost luggage? How will you update me?
Will you deliver the bag to my hotel
when you find it? And importantly, does
the airline offer any compensation for
essential items I need to buy now, like
toiletries?" The source mentions you'll
probably fill out a form often called a
PIR property irregularity report. Good
to know. Okay, moving on to more serious
issues. What if you feel unwell? Health
first. Always simple phrases for feeling
sick. I don't feel well or I feel sick.
Maybe be more specific. I feel dizzy. I
have a headache, stomach ache, fever.
And if it feels more serious, I need to
see a doctor. I think I need to go to
the hospital. How do you ask for help?
Approach staff, hotel, station, airport,
or even just someone on the street.
Excuse me, can you help me? I'm not
feeling well. Ask, "Is there a first aid
station nearby?" Or, "Where is the
nearest pharmacy?" Note, the source
mentions in the UK and some other places
are often called chemists. And for real
emergency, can you call an ambulance,
please? Don't hesitate if it's serious.
What about allergies or existing
conditions? The source has a great tip
here. Carry a small card with that info
clearly written in English and ideally
translate it into the local language
too. You can show it if needed. Phrases
you might use. I am allergic to peanuts.
I have
diabetes. Also, know how to provide your
emergency contact details. Very smart
tip. Okay. Other potential problems,
losing vital documents. Losing your
passport or wallet is terrifying. First
step is usually reporting it. I have
lost my passport wallet. Ask, "Where's
the nearest police station?" Especially
if you suspect theft. For a lost
passport, you'll need your embassy.
Where is the embassy for your country?
What if you're just plain lost and feel
unsafe? Find someone official looking or
dump into a shop and say, "I'm lost and
I don't know where I am." Can you help
me find my hotel? It's called the hotel
name. And reporting an accident or
witnessing something. There has been an
accident. I need to report a theft.
General emergency phrases, the real
basics. Help. I need help urgently to
request emergency services. Call the
police. Call the fire department. Call
an ambulance. Be ready to give your
name, your location. I am at address
landmark. And the nature of the
emergency, the emergency is the source's
overall point here. Being prepared with
even a few of these phrases can make a
huge difference in staying calm and
getting the help you need quickly. Know
the local emergency number for the
country you're in. And travel insurance
is always recommended. Absolutely. Okay,
we've covered the practicalities, the
problems, but the source also adds
another layer, right, about fitting in
and using tech. Yeah. Adding some
finesse, notes on cultural nuances and
tech tools to make things even smoother.
Let's talk etiquette on public transport
first. It varies, right? Hugely. Yeah.
But the source says general politeness
is usually a good guide. One big one,
especially in places like the UK, is
queuing lining up properly. Don't cut in
line. Good rule for life, really. What
about seats? Generally, it's considered
good manners to offer your seat to
elderly people, pregnant women, people
with disabilities, or those with very
young children. Many systems have
designated priority seats for this
personal space. Be mindful, especially
when it's crowded. Don't sprawl out.
Don't put your bags on empty seats if
people are standing. Avoid leaning
heavily on poles others might need to
hold. Some cultures value personal space
more than others. Noise levels. keep
phone calls and conversations reasonably
quiet. The source mentions Japan has a
strong manner mode culture on trains and
Parisians aren't fans of loud talkers on
the metro. Basically, don't be
disruptive. Eating and drinking policies
really vary. Sometimes it's banned
outright, sometimes just discouraged,
especially smelly food. Best bet is to
see what locals are doing. If nobody
else is eating, maybe save your snack
for later. And getting on and off. Let
people get off the train or bus before
you try to get on. Don't block the
doorways or aisles with yourself or your
luggage. Simple courtesy really. And a
basic please and thank you go a long
long way. The source even mentions that
in France a simple bonjour hello to the
bus driver when you board is customary.
Oh, and that ticket validation point.
Yes, crucial. In some places like
Germany, on some systems like trams or
local trains, you have to validate your
ticket in a machine before you board or
risk a big fine if an inspector checks.
Watch what others do. Observing locals
seems key. Okay, what about tech? How
can apps help? Technology is a massive
help these days. The source highlights
several types of travel apps. Navigation
is obvious. Google Maps, Citymapper,
which is excellent for public transport
options. Maps.mme for offline maps, ride
sharing apps. Yep. Uber, Lift, Grab,
common in Southeast Asia, Bolt, depends
on the region. They simplify booking and
payment. Airline and train apps. Most
airlines and many train companies have
their own apps now for booking,
check-in, getting your boarding pass
digitally and getting delay updates.
Super useful and for the language
barrier itself. Translation apps are
game changers. Google Translate is the
big one, especially with features like
conversation mode or Google Lens, which
lets you point your camera at text like
a sign or menu and see it translated on
your screen. Wow, that's amazing. There
are also apps like Rome to Rio that help
you figure out how to get between places
using multiple modes of transport. And a
simple currency converter app is always
handy. Any specific phrases related to
tech. You might need to ask, is there
Wi-Fi here to use your apps? Or which
app is best for checking bus schedules?
Or showing your phone, can I show you my
ticket on the app? What about those
ticket machines in stations? They can
look intimidating. They can, but the
source points out that almost all ticket
machines in international hubs have an
English language option. Look for a
little flag icon or the word English.
Once you find English, what are the
usual steps? Typically, select language,
choose your destination, select the
ticket type, single, return, adult,
child. Choose the number of tickets,
confirm the details, pay, check if it
takes cash, card, or both. Take your
ticket and any change. And if you get
stuck with the machine, don't be
embarrassed to ask for help. Ask station
staff or even someone waiting in line,
"Excuse me, could you help me with this
machine?" Or, "I'm trying to buy a
ticket to destination. Does this machine
give change? Does it accept credit
cards?" And so combining that
techsavviness with awareness of local
customs really helps reduce stress and
just makes the whole travel experience
smoother and more enjoyable according to
the source. Wow. Okay. We have covered a
lot of ground today or maybe I should
say a lot of transport systems. We
really have. From those basic building
blocks, the verbs and questions right
through navigating airports, taxis,
rental cars, buses, trains, subways,
fairies, tuk tuks, asking for
directions, handling problems like
delays or lost luggage, and even
thinking about cultural etiquette and
using technology. It's pretty
comprehensive. It really feels like the
source provides this amazing toolkit.
And the goal, like you said earlier,
isn't about fluency. It's about
confidence. Exactly. Confidence to
handle those key moments that, as that
study showed, cause so much anxiety for
so many travelers. Remember that third
of people feeling anxious? Yeah. So,
knowing all this is great, but the
crucial part is actually using it.
What's the call to action from the
source? It's very practical. They
suggest thinking about your next trip,
real or imagined, and pick just one
section we talked about today. The one
that feels most relevant or maybe the
one that still feels a bit scary. Is it
the airport? Using the
subway, renting a car. Okay, just focus
on one area. Then go back through that
section and just write down five key
phrases. Only five. The ones that really
jumped out or the ones you know you'd
need in that situation. Don't try to
memorize everything at once. Five key
phrases, manageable. And here's the most
important step. Practice saying those
five phrases out loud this week. Say
them while you're cooking, walking,
whatever. Just get used to the sound,
the feeling of saying them. Precisely.
Practice making your mouth form the
words. The more you say them out loud,
the less likely you are to freeze up
when you actually need them. They become
more automatic. That makes sense. And
they also suggested reflecting. Yeah.
Think about one specific transport
situation that maybe used to fill you
with a bit of dread. buying that
complicated train ticket, hailing a taxi
in a busy street, whatever it was, after
listening today, do you feel maybe just
a little bit more prepared for it now?
Acknowledge that shift, however small.
Okay, remember that feeling we talked
about at the start, standing on a street
corner somewhere new, feeling totally
lost, anxious. Yeah, that uh-oh moment.
Now, imagine that same situation, but
this time you have those five phrases
practiced. You take a breath. You look
around. You see someone who looks
friendly. You walk over, smile, and
actually say something. Excuse me. Could
you tell me how to get to Exactly. That
single act, just being able to ask that
question using the English you've
learned, it changes everything. It's not
just about getting from A to B anymore.
Not at all. It's about connection. It's
about problem solving. It's about
independence. These phrases, they're not
just words. They're keys. Keys to
freedom. Keys to feeling capable. keys
to unlocking much richer travel
experiences. You stop being just a
tourist looking in from the outside and
you become an active participant able to
navigate the world a little more
confidently. That's the goal. Use these
keys. Yeah. Go explore.

it.
[Music]
Day one is all about getting oriented
with the IELTS speaking test and
building your confidence with the
basics. So, what is the IELTS speaking
test format? Good question. The speaking
test is a face-to-face interview, either
in person or via video link that lasts
about 11 to 14 minutes. It has three
parts. Part one, introduction and
interview, four to 5 minutes. The
examiner asks simple questions about you
like your work, studies, family,
hometown, interests. Part two, long
turn, 3 to four minutes total. You get a
Q card with a topic, have one minute to
prepare, then speak for up to two
minutes on that topic. Then the examiner
might ask one to two follow-up
questions. Part three, two-way
discussion, four to five minutes. More
abstract questions related to the part
two topic where you discuss opinions and
ideas with the examiner. Knowing this
structure is key. Many learners feel
less nervous when they know what to
expect. You don't want any surprises on
test day regarding format. Exactly. Now,
our focus for day one is on part one.
Those first four to five minutes of Q&A
about you. It sounds easy, but it's
super important because it sets the
tone. The goal is to answer confidently
and naturally. Tip for day one, be
authentic and don't memorize your
answers. I've seen students try to
memorize a perfect answer for what do
you do or where are you from. Trust me,
examiners can immediately tell if you're
reciting a memorized answer. It comes
out unnatural and stilted. Right? The
IELTS examiners are trained to spot
wrote answers. If your response doesn't
flow like a normal conversation, it's a
red flag. Plus, if you get a memorized
answer that doesn't exactly fit the
question, you'll go off topic. So,
instead, prepare ideas for common
topics, but speak in your own words each
time. Think of part one like a casual
chat. The examiner might ask about your
hometown. So, you should be ready to say
a couple of interesting things about it,
but not as a scripted speech, just
naturally. Let's practice a typical part
one scenario. I'll pretend to be the
examiner, and ask you a question, Emma,
and you answer as the candidate. Ready?
Ready. Let's talk about your hometown.
Where is your hometown? I'm from a small
city in the north of my country. It's
called Greenwood. One thing I love about
Greenwood is how green and peaceful it
is, as its name suggests. We have lots
of parks and treelined streets. It's not
very big, maybe about a 100,000 people.
So, it has a friendly, close-knit
community feel. Great answer. You see,
Emma didn't just say, "My hometown is
Greenwood." She gave a bit more detail
and even a fun fact about the name. She
sounded relaxed, like she was proud of
her town. Exactly. I gave two to three
sentences, which is a good length for
part one. Typically, aim for two to four
sentences for each answer so you can
showcase your fluency. And I included a
collocation, close-knit community,
meaning a tight, friendly community.
Little phrases like that can boost your
impression. Also, notice the tone. It
was conversational. Part one is not the
time for big academic words or long
complex sentences. It's about you. So
your language can be everyday language
just clearly and coherently delivered.
Let's do one more example. This time
maybe show a common mistake and then the
corrected version. I'll answer badly
first then better. You be the examiner
again. Sure. Do you work or study? Work.
Okay. That was an example of how not to
answer. Just saying work is too short.
It doesn't show your English ability at
all. You'd be surprised. Some candidates
actually give one-word or very short
answers like that due to nerves or
thinking part one isn't important. But
giving yes, no, or one-word answers is a
mistake because you're not demonstrating
fluency. Exactly. Now, I'll answer it
properly. Do you work or study? I
currently work as a junior accountant at
a tech company. I've been working there
for about 2 years now. I really enjoy it
because I'm learning a lot, though it
can be stressful at times. Much better.
In that answer, you said you work,
where, for how long, and even added a
quick what you feel about it. That's a
solid part one response. I also used a
filler phrase at times, which means
sometimes to add a natural touch. Using
such common phrases or linking words
help your answer flow. Other examples
are starting with well actually or
honestly. For instance, honestly, I work
as an accountant. It sounds like real
speech. Just be careful not to overuse
fillers. A few make you sound natural.
Too many can make it seem like you're
avoiding the question. Keep a balance.
Another tip, speak up and speak clearly.
I know it's day one and you might feel
nervous, but try to speak as if you're
talking to a friendly colleague. The
examiner isn't there to judge your
opinions, just your English. So, if you
relax a bit, your voice will sound more
confident. And don't worry about your
accent. Any accent is fine as long as
you are clear. IELTS examiners are used
to all accents. So, focus more on
clarity of speech and pronunciation of
individual words rather than trying to
sound British or American. One more
common mistake in part one, overly
formal answers. For example, some
students think they should answer like,
"Thank you for asking. Regarding your
question about my hometown, it is
located. That's not necessary. It's too
stiff. The examiner actually prefers a
more natural style. Absolutely. Just be
polite and personable. Say, "My
hometown, not regarding your query, my
hometown is." That's overkill. So, to
wrap up day one, you've got the format
down and you know to answer part one
questions with a few sentences in a
friendly, natural way. Key takeaways.
Don't memorize exact answers. Be
genuine. Avoid extremely short answers.
Give a little detail and start building
confidence by practicing talking about
yourself, your life, work, studies,
family in English. Great. If you've done
day one right, you should feel a bit
more comfortable speaking about easy
topics. Keep it up. Now, on to day two.
[Music]
Welcome to day two. Now that you're
oriented, we're going to work on
extending your answers and improving
fluency. This is a make orb breakak
skill for moving up from band five or
six to band seven plus. Exactly. In day
one, we touched on giving more than
one-word answers. In day two, we dive
deeper into how to expand your answers
so that you're really showing the
examiner your English ability. Remember,
the examiner can't judge what you know,
only what you say. So, you want to say
enough to showcase your skills. A good
rule of thumb, if a question can be
answered in one word, like, "Do you like
X?" Yes. Always add more. Explain why,
give an example, or add a little detail.
Aim for that two, three sentence sweet
spot for part one. Let's illustrate this
with an example. I'll use a typical part
one question. Do you enjoy cooking? If I
answer just no, not really. That's
honest, but it's too short. I should
extend it. A better answer. Honestly,
not really. I'm not much of a cook
because I find the whole process
stressful. For example, when I try to
follow a recipe, I often end up burning
something. I prefer quick meals or
having someone else cook if possible.
That was great. You started with
honestly, not really. So, you still
answered the question, which is
important. You said no, you don't enjoy
cooking, but then you added because and
gave a reason plus an example. Right?
Using that because plus example formula
is a simple way to extend your answer.
Think answer because example detail. We
can call this the AB method. Answer the
question directly. Give a because
reason. Provide an example or extra
detail. Love it. AB. For instance, if
the question was, do you like reading? A
short answer. Yes, I do. An AB extended
answer. Yes, I do. I especially enjoy
reading historical fiction because I
love learning about past eras through
stories. For example, I recently read a
novel about medieval Japan, and it
taught me a lot about the culture while
being really entertaining. Excellent.
That answer not only shows you like
reading, but also shows off vocabulary
like historical fiction and medieval. It
gives the examiner more to chew on.
Another tip, use natural filler phrases
to give yourself a second to think,
especially in part one and part three.
We mentioned a few briefly, phrases
like, "Well, let me think." Actually, to
be honest, these can be lifesavers if
you need to gather your thoughts for a
second. They sound natural and not like
you're freeling up. Just be careful to
answer the question after your filler.
Don't use a filler phrase and then trail
off or go silent. Use it as a bridge to
your actual answer. Also, varying your
tone and pace helps fluency. If you
speak in a monotone, it might sound like
you're unsure or bored. We'll talk more
about intonation on day six, but even in
these short answers, try to sound
interested in what you're saying. It
actually makes you more fluent because
you're engaged with the topic. Good
point. Another aspect of fluency is not
pausing too much. It's okay to take a
moment to think. We all do. But avoid
pausing after every word. Sometimes
nervous speakers end up saying, "I go to
the university in my city." With lots of
hesitation. Work on speaking in phrases,
not word by word. A fun practice is to
take a simple question and see if you
can keep talking about it for 30 seconds
straight. Time yourself. For example,
tell me about your best friend. Can you
speak for half a minute about that? If
yes, you're on the right track. If not,
practice adding details. And remember,
fluency doesn't mean speaking super
fast. In fact, speaking too fast can
hurt clarity. Fluency means the flow of
words is smooth. You can be fluent at a
moderate pace. So, find a pace that's
comfortable for you and doesn't lead to
a lot of um moments. Let's mention a
common pitfall. Overusing filler words
like um uh you know, a few are natural.
Even native speakers say um but too many
can be distracting and make you seem
less fluent. It's a hard habit to break,
but being aware of it is the first step.
One technique is to replace um with a
short pause or a linking word. For
example, instead of I um went to the
park and um it was fun, practice I went
to the park and it was fun. The brief
silence is actually less noticeable than
a drawn out um and using a connector
like and or so can link ideas without
resorting to uh great advice. So,
summarizing day two, the goal is to
lengthen your answers and smooth out
your speech. Key tip: answer plus
because plus example is a handy
structure. Use filler phrases to give
yourself a moment like well let me think
instead of freezing. Avoid one-word
answers at all costs. Always expand and
work on reducing those ums by replacing
them with natural connectors or just a
short breath. If you follow these tips,
you'll start sounding more fluent and
coherent, which covers two big scoring
areas, fluency and coherence. All right,
coming up next is part two practice. Get
ready for day

three. Day three is here. Almost halfway
through our 7-day challenge. Day three,
focus IELTS speaking part two, the long
turn. Many of you might find this part
intimidating because you have to speak
alone for up to 2 minutes. But don't
worry, we've got tips to help make part
two easier. Part two is the part where
you get a Q card with a topic and
usually three, four bullet points to
guide you on what to talk about. For
example, describe a memorable trip you
have taken with bullet points like where
you went, who you went with, what you
did, and why it was memorable. You get 1
minute to prepare during which you can
jot down notes on paper. Then you have
to speak for 1 to 2 minutes
continuously. The examiner will stop you
after 2 minutes if you haven't stopped
already. The key challenges in part two
are speaking at length, organizing your
talk, and staying on topic, covering
those bullet points. We'll tackle each
of these. Tip for day three, have a
basic structure in mind for your part
two answer. One simple structure that
works for many Qards is one,
introduction, a one-s sentence intro of
what you're going to talk about. Eg, I'd
like to talk about a trip to the
mountains I went on last year. Two,
details, story. This is the main part.
Cover the bullet points in a narrative
flow. You could go in order of the
prompts or in a timeline. What happened
first, next, etc. Three, conclusion, a
wrap-up sentence about why it was
memorable or how you feel about it now.
Also, it's perfectly fine to use the
past, present, future technique for
storytelling Qards like first set the
scene, past, when, where it was, who
with, then talk about what you did, past
continuous or past simple events, and
perhaps mention the present or future.
Even today, I still remember it clearly.
Or, it's an experience that will help me
in the future because Great. Let's do a
demo. I'll be the candidate and give a
part two response. Jake, you act as the
examiner and give me a Q card. Sure.
Your Q card is describe a memorable trip
you took. You should say where you went,
who you went with, what you did, and
explain why it was memorable. You have
one minute to prepare your notes. Note
to listeners, this is where you can
pause the podcast for a minute if you
want to practice planning your own
answer for this Q card. Emma will start
her answer as if one minute has passed.
All right, Emma, you may begin. Okay.
I'd like to talk about a memorable trip
I took just last year. I went to the
mountains to a place called Aspen with
my best friend. We spent a week there
during winter. First of all, where we
went. Aspen is a ski town. So, as you
can guess, we went there to ski and
snowboard. It was actually the first
time I had ever seen real snow, so I was
over the moon with excitement, meaning I
was extremely happy. Every day, we would
hit the slopes early in the morning and
stay out until sunset. Now, who I went
with, I was with my best friend, Julia.
She's an experienced snowboarder, so she
taught me a lot. We also joined a small
tour group, so we met other travelers,
which was fun. As for what we did, aside
from skiing, we did a few other things.
One day, we went on a snowshoeing hike
through the forest, which was beautiful.
Everything was covered in fresh snow. It
was like a winter wonderland. We also
explored the town. Aspen has this really
quaint downtown area with cozy cafes and
shops. In the evenings, we'd relaxed by
the fireplace at our lodge, just
chatting or playing cards. Why it was
memorable? Well, there are a few
reasons. Firstly, the natural beauty was
breathtaking. I had never been
surrounded by mountains like that.
Secondly, it was a big challenge for me
to learn skiing. On the third day, I
attempted a pretty tough ski run. I was
terrified at first. I even fell a couple
of times, but I didn't give up. When I
finally made it down successfully, I
felt so accomplished. We still joke
about how I almost crashed into a tree.
Finally, it was special because of the
company. Sharing that experience with my
best friend made it unforgettable. We
created memories I'll cherish for a
lifetime. So, overall, that trip to
Aspen was one of the best trips I've
ever had. It not only gave me a new
hobby that I love, skiing, but also
brought me closer to my friend. I'll
remember it for years to come. Stops.
Wow, that was a fantastic part two
answer. I'm going to unpack a few things
you did really well there for our
listeners benefit. Please do. I hope I
covered everything you did. You clearly
covered all the bullet points. Where
Aspen in the mountains who with best
friend plus others what you did, skiing,
snowboarding, snowshoeing, exploring
town, and why it was memorable. It
helped to follow the prompts. I kind of
talked in the order of the bullet points
with a bit of a story mixed in, right?
It felt like a coherent story. You
started by introducing the trip, then
went through the activities and wrapped
up with why it was special. It flowed
well, which is important. I also tried
to use some interesting vocabulary. For
example, I said over the moon to mean
very happy. I used hit the slopes, a
casual phrase meaning go skiing/
snowboarding. I used the word quaint to
describe the town, meaning charming in
an old-fashioned way. Yes, those are
great words, phrases. Idioms like over
the moon can impress the examiner if
used naturally. And hit the slopes is a
good phrasal verb specific to skiing
context. It shows you have range. I want
to point out I didn't memorize that
answer. I just have practiced similar
topics, so the phrases come to mind.
Listeners, you should practice lots of
common part two topics, travel, a gift,
a person you admire, etc., so you have
ideas and some vocab. But remember not
to memorize full answers or it can sound
unnatural as we warned. Another thing,
you spoke for the full 2 minutes without
much hesitation. That's important. On
exam day, aim to keep speaking until the
examiner stops you. If you finish early
and there's silence, it can be awkward
and you might lose an opportunity to
show your speaking fluency. A trick, if
you think you've said all the bullet
points and still have time, add a
personal reflection or an afterthought.
Like I added, I'll remember it for years
to come. It wraps up the talk nicely.
Let's discuss common part two mistakes
quickly. Stopping too soon. Some people
only speak for one minute or less and
then go blank. Try to avoid that by
practicing timing yourself. If you go
blank, try to elaborate on something you
already said. Eg. Oh, and another reason
it was memorable is reading off notes.
You can use your notes for reference,
but don't read them word for word. It
will sound unnatural and your eye
contact and fluency might suffer. Use
key words only. Ignoring a bullet point.
It's easy to forget one of the points on
the card. In practice, train yourself to
glance at the card or your notes to
ensure you covered each prompt. It's not
the end of the world if you miss one,
but it's better to cover them. Running
out of ideas. If that happens, consider
adding a hypothetical or comparison. For
example, I've talked about one trip and
I suppose if I compare it to other
trips, this one was the most memorable
because this way you still keep talking.
Those are great tips. One more. Don't
worry if you go slightly off topic as
long as it's related. Sometimes your
story might stray from the bullet points
a bit. It's okay if it's still relevant
to the main topic, but do try to circle
back to the question and use that one
minute prep time wisely. Jot down quick
notes, maybe one keyword for each
bullet, plus any fancy vocab or idiom
you want to include. For my example, I
might note mountains, friend Julia, ski/
snowboard, fell down, proud, beautiful.
That's enough to remind me. Exactly. No
full sentences and notes. just triggers
for your memory. All right, day three
done. To recap, key tip for part two,
practice speaking for two minutes in a
structured way. Introduction of topic,
supporting details, use the bullet
points, and a conclusion. Use
storytelling techniques and personal
experience to make it flow. And try to
include some descriptive vocabulary or
an idiom naturally. Most importantly,
keep talking. Don't stop until they stop
you. You've got it. Take a breather and
get ready for day four. We'll tackle
part three questions
[Music]
next. Welcome to day four. Now we move
on to speaking part three, which is
often considered the hardest part by
many candidates. In part three, you'll
discuss more general or abstract topics
with the examiner, usually related to
whatever you spoke about in part two.
Right? Part three questions often ask
for your opinion or to discuss pros and
cons, compare past and present or
speculate about the future. It's more of
a discussion, almost like a short
interview or conversation about deeper
issues. The key skills here are
analytical thinking and expressing
complex ideas in English. But don't be
scared by complex. You can still use
clear, straightforward language to give
a great answer. You just might need a
bit more structure and reasoning. Tip
for day four. Give extended, well
ststructured answers and paraphrase the
question in your response. Let's break
that down. Extended answers. For part
three, aim for a little longer than part
one, maybe four to five sentences or
even more if it flows well. This is your
chance to show depth, structured
answers. Use linking words and
signposting like first, on the other
hand, for example, to organize your
thoughts. Paraphrase. Don't just repeat
the question back. Use synonyms or
rephrase the questions key words to show
your range. Let's practice a part three
question. Suppose my part two was about
a trip to the mountains. A part three
question might be, "What are the
advantages and disadvantages of tourism
in natural places like mountains?"
Instead of starting my answer with the
advantages and disadvantages of tourism
in natural places are, which just
mirrors the question, I could
paraphrase. I think tourism in natural
areas like mountain regions has both
upsides and downsides. See, I didn't say
advantages and disadvantages exactly. I
said upsides. Good move. Then you'd
continue to elaborate. Maybe give one
advantage and one disadvantage with
examples. Exactly. I might continue. One
major advantage is that tourism brings
economic benefits to those areas. For
example, local businesses like hotels,
restaurants, and guides earn more income
when tourists visit. On the other hand,
a significant downside is the
environmental impact. More tourists can
lead to problems like litter,
disturbance to wildlife or pollution in
those pristine areas. In my opinion, the
key is responsible tourism like
eco-friendly practices so that we
maximize the benefits and minimize the
harm. That's a strong answer. Let's
examine it. You used one major advantage
and a significant downside. clear
signposting of two sides. You used on
the other hand to contrast, a classic
linker for discussing two sides and it
sounded natural. You gave examples,
economic benefits, hotels, restaurants
versus environmental impact, litter,
wildlife disturbance, and you gave your
opinion at the end and even a solution,
responsible tourism. That's a strong
answer. Let's examine it. You used one
major advantage and a significant
downside. Clear signposting of two
sides. You used on the other hand to
contrast a classic linker for discussing
two sides. And it sounded natural. You
gave examples economic benefits, hotels,
restaurants versus environmental impact,
litter, wildlife disturbance. You gave
your opinion at the end and even a
solution, responsible tourism. Part
three answers benefit from that kind of
structure. It shows you can handle
complex ideas. And note, I didn't use
overly fancy words. I used some good
words like pristine, meaning untouched,
but mostly I focused on clarity. Right?
A misconception is that you need to use
extremely academic words in part three.
It's great if you know some topic
specific vocabulary like sustainable
tourism, biodiversity for environment
topics, or digital revolution for tech
topics. But clarity and correct usage
are more important than just throwing
big words around. Another example of a
part three question might be related to
our earlier part two on travel. How has
travel changed in the past few decades?
This asks you to compare past and
present. A good approach is to use
comparative language and different
tenses. Well, travel has changed
dramatically in the last 20 to 30 years.
In the past, it was more expensive and
less common for people to travel
overseas. Flights were costlier, and not
everyone could afford international
trips. Nowadays, travel is much more
accessible. Budget airlines and online
booking have made it easier for a lot of
people. Also, with the internet,
planning trips is simpler because you
can research destinations, book
accommodations, and so on. As a result,
you see more people traveling more
frequently today than before. Excellent.
That answer uses past versus present
comparisons. Well, phrases like in the
past versus nowadays clearly indicate
the time frames. You also used the
present perfect has changed to summarize
the change over time. A nice grammatical
touch. Let's hit some quick common
mistakes in part three. Going off topic
because the questions are deeper. Some
candidates start rambling into unrelated
areas. Keep listening carefully to the
question and make sure you're addressing
it. If the question is about travel
changing, don't drift into talking about
your personal travel story unless it's a
quick example. Stick to the general
trend, pariting the question. As we
said, don't repeat the exact wording of
the question in your answer. Not only
does it waste time, it also doesn't show
your language skills. Paraphrase it.
Short answers. Just like part one, if
you give a one-s sentence answer in part
three, it's usually not enough. These
questions are designed to be open-ended.
If the examiner asks, "Why do you think
some people prefer solo travel to group
travel?" and you say, "Because they like
independence," and stop, that's not
enough. You should expand. I think it's
because they like the independence. When
you travel solo, you can do whatever you
want, whenever you want. For instance,
if I travel alone, I can change my plans
on a whim without worrying about anyone
else. Some people really enjoy that
freedom. Of course, others might find it
lonely, but for independent-minded
travelers, it's ideal. Using too many
linkers unnaturally. We touched on this.
Some students try to insert transitional
words in every sentence. Firstly,
moreover, furthermore, this can sound
memorized or just odd in speech. Use a
few, but mix them up and use
conversational ones too, like also or
plus. Not asking for clarification when
needed. If you get a part three question
and you don't understand it fully, it's
okay to ask. You could say, I'm sorry,
could you rephrase the question or do
you mean X or Y? This is better than
guessing and answering incorrectly. Just
don't overuse this. You shouldn't need
to ask for every question. Great points.
Another tip, if you find yourself stuck
on a part three question, you can buy
time with a phrase and think. For
example, hm, that's a tough question.
I've never thought about that before, to
be honest. This gives you a moment to
plan your answer in your head. Just make
sure you do follow up with an answer.
Yes. And if you're really unsure, you
can give a speculative answer. It's
better to try than to say nothing. Use
phrases like maybe or it's possible that
to show you're guessing. Eg. It's hard
to say, but maybe in the future most
people might travel virtually rather
than physically. Who knows? This shows
you're willing to tackle the question
even if it's challenging. Before we wrap
day four, quick mention of grammar in
part three. This is a good time to show
off some complex structures if you can.
Conditionals, comparatives, passive
voice if relevant, etc. like you did
with the present perfect and
comparisons, but again, only use them if
you're comfortable. Don't force it.
Exactly. Clear and correctly used
grammar beats complicated but flawed
grammar. So, day four key tip. Treat
part three like a short discussion where
you provide a wellorganized answer with
reasons and examples. Address the
question directly paraphrasing it and
aim to explore the idea from multiple
angles. For example, pros, cons, past,
present, personal versus general
perspective. Show off your ability to
discuss ideas in English, but keep it
natural and logical. Great job. That
covers all three parts of the test
across days 1 through 4. Now, we'll
shift gears a bit. Days five and six
will zero in on skills that apply across
all parts: vocabulary and pronunciation,
grammar. Stay with us.
Day five is vocabulary day, one of my
favorite topics. By now, you have a good
sense of how to approach each part of
the speaking test. Now, let's focus on
lexical resource, which is IELTS speak
for vocabulary. Vocabulary is 25% of
your speaking score, one of the four
criteria. To get a high score, you need
to show range using different words, not
repeating the same simple words and some
less common words or idioms accurately.
Basically, you want to sound like you
have a rich, natural vocabulary. But a
warning up front, using big words
incorrectly or throwing idioms
everywhere will not impress the
examiner. In fact, it can backfire if
misused. Quality over quantity. We want
to teach you some useful vocabulary, but
you must use it appropriately. Well
said. So, today we will introduce a few
high impact idioms, some common
collocations, word pairings, a couple of
useful phrasal verbs, and point out some
vocabulary mistakes to avoid. Let's
start with idioms. Using idiomatic
language can boost you to a band seven
or higher in vocabulary if done right.
Idioms are those phrases like piece of
cake or once in a blue moon which have
meanings not obvious from the individual
words. The trick with idioms and IELTS
is to use them naturally and mostly in
informal topics part one or maybe part
two. In part three, if it's a formal
topic, maybe avoid overly colloquial
idioms. But a well-placed idiom or two
in the whole interview can definitely
help. Some common idioms that could fit
a variety of topics. A piece of cake
means very easy. Could be used in part
one. Do you find cooking difficult? For
me, making pasta is a piece of cake
because I've done it so many times. Once
in a blue moon means very rarely. Itchy.
I only go to the cinema once in a blue
moon. I prefer watching movies at home.
To be over the moon, we used this in day
three, meaning extremely happy. Eg. I
was over the moon when I got my
university acceptance letter. Burning
the midnight oil means staying up late
working, studying. Eg. I was burning the
midnight oil before my exams last month.
On cloud9 also means very happy, similar
to over the moon. Eg. She was on cloud9
when she heard the news. cost an arm and
a leg means very expensive. Eg. I'd love
to buy a new iPhone, but it costs an arm
and a leg. Great list. Of course, don't
try to cram all of those in one test,
but learning a few that match common
topics is smart. For example, costs an
arm and a leg could be used if talking
about shopping or technology prices.
Burning the midnight oil if talking
about study habits or work. Next, let's
talk about collocations. These are
natural word pairings. Examiners listen
for these because it shows a deeper
knowledge of English. For instance, we
say heavy rain, not strong rain. That
would sound odd. Do homework, not make
homework. Take a photo, not do a photo.
Make a mistake, not do a mistake. Give a
presentation. Give a speech, not make a
speech. Fast food, not quick food.
Interested in, not interested on. Using
these correctly can really show you have
native like proficiency. It might not be
flashy, but it's very effective. Now,
phrasal verbs, those little verb plus
preposition combos like grow up, find
out, come across that are super common
in spoken English. These can add a lot
of naturalness to your speech. For
example, come up with to think of an
idea. We need to come up with a plan.
Figure out to solve or understand. I'm
trying to figure out how to use this new
phone. Run out of to have no more of
something. I ran out of time on the last
question. Get along with to have good
relations with. I get along with my
co-workers really well. Pick up. To
learn informally. I picked up some
Spanish when I lived in Mexico. point
out to highlight. I should point out
that not everyone agrees with this idea.
Notice using phrasal verbs often makes
your speech sound more natural and less
like a textbook. For example, instead of
saying discover, saying find out in
conversation is very normal. Instead of
tolerate, people often say put up with.
Yes. Put up with noise, tolerate noise,
keep on doing something, continue doing
something. For IELTS, it's good to
sprinkle a few in, particularly in part
one and two, where the style is more
informal. In part three, you might use
fewer phrasal verbs if discussing a
formal topic, but one or two can still
appear. Now, common vocabulary mistakes
to avoid, misusing big words. Students
sometimes think, I need to use very
advanced words to get band eight or
nine. So, they throw in words like
plethora or ameliorate in weird ways. If
you're not 100% sure of a word's meaning
and usage, don't use it. It's painfully
obvious to an examiner if a word is out
of place or used awkwardly. It's better
to use a simpler word correctly.
Repetition. As we mentioned, repeating
the same basic word over and over can
limit your score. For example, in part
two, if you're describing a beautiful
place and you say beautiful five times,
try to add variety. Say scenic,
picturesque, breathtaking if you can. Or
instead of saying very, very important,
you could say crucial, or essential for
one of those instances. Slang and very
informal words. Avoid slang like cool,
awesome, gonna, wanna, say going to or
want to or profanity. Obviously, some
casual words like kids for children or
job for occupation are fine, but don't
go too far into street slang. Wrong
collocations. This is tricky, but if
you're unsure, try to recall if you've
heard an expression before. For example,
some learners say do mistakes or strong
rain. We know those are incorrect
collocations. Pay attention when you
read or listen to English and mimic
those combinations. Perhaps we can
demonstrate a bad versus good use of
vocabulary in a quick roleplay. I'll
give a not so good answer with some
errors and then we'll improve it. Sounds
fun. Go ahead. Question. Why do some
people prefer to live in the countryside
rather than the city? Bad answer. They
prefer countryside because it's more
Pacific and not contaminated like city.
In city, there is strong traffic and
much pollution, but countryside has pure
air and is more silent. Okay, that
answer had the right idea, but some word
choices were off. Pacific as an
adjective is wrong here. I think you
meant peaceful. Contaminated is a bit
too strong or specific a word for
general pollution context. It's not
wrong, but polluted would fit better.
Strong traffic is a wrong collocation.
We'd say heavy traffic. Much pollution
should be a lot of pollution in spoken
English. Pure air, we usually say clean
or fresh air. Silent, we'd say quiet in
this context, right? So, a corrected
answer. I think many people prefer the
countryside because it's more peaceful
and not as polluted as the city. In
cities, there is heavy traffic and a lot
of pollution, but in the countryside,
the air is clean and it's much quieter.
That version is much more natural. Those
collocations and word choices are what
examiners listen for even subconsciously
to gauge your lexical resource. Exactly.
So, for day five summary, learn a
handful of idioms that you can use
naturally, especially for feelings or
common situations. Examiners reward good
idiomatic usage. Use collocations and
phrasal verbs to sound natural. This
often impresses without sounding forced.
Avoid wrote big words or incorrect
usage. It's not a vocabulary exam. It's
about effective communication. A few
higher level words are great, but only
if you're comfortable with them. And
remember, reading and listening in
English is one of the best ways to
improve vocabulary. When you hear native
speakers use a phrase, take note and
imitate. Absolutely. All right, that was
a lot of vocab talk. Hope you're still
with us. Day six, we'll hit grammar and
pronunciation, which are just as
important. Let's keep pushing
[Music]
forward. We're on day six now, which is
about grammar and pronunciation. The
remaining two criteria for IELTS
speaking both are crucial for getting a
band seven, eight or nine. Right? So far
we focused on what to say and how to
structure it. Now let's ensure you say
it accurately and clearly. Grammar
first. The criterion is grammatical
range and accuracy. This means they look
at range. Are you using a variety of
structures or are all your sentences
simple subject verb object ones?
Accuracy. Are you making a lot of
mistakes that impede understanding or
just minor slips? To score high, you
want to show some complex structures
correctly. For instance, include a mix
of simple and complex sentences. Maybe a
conditional, maybe a relative clause,
maybe a mix of past, present, future
tenses as context requires. But don't
force grammar that doesn't fit. Instead,
expand your sentences naturally. For
example, take a simple sentence and add
detail. Simple. People like living in my
city. Complex. One reason people like
living in my city is that it's very
convenient. Here I used a subordinate
clause is that it's very convenient. Or
use a relative clause. My city has many
parks which are great for families.
which are great for families is a
relative clause adding info. Another
example, combined sentences. The city is
crowded. Many people live there.
Combined, the city, which has a
population of over 10 million, is
crowded. That shows off a relative
clause. Or the city is crowded because
millions of people live there, showing
you can use a conjunction to form a
complex sentence. Also try to use
different tenses appropriately. Past for
past experiences, stories in part two.
Present for current habits, general
truths. Present perfect when talking
about experience up to now. I have lived
here all my life. Future for predictions
in part three. I think the situation
will change in the future. Using a
conditional can be impressive. Eg. If I
had the chance, I would study abroad in
the future. Or if more people work from
home, it could lead to less traffic in
cities. Just make sure the conditional
is correct. A common mistake, mixing
them up, like saying if I will have
time, I will should be if I have time, I
will. Review conditionals if you're
shaky on them. Yes, paying attention to
those little things helps. Another thing
articles a and the many learners drop
them or use them wrong. For example,
saying I am student instead of I am a
student. It's a small mistake but can
add up if frequent. Plural singular
agreement is another. People is should
be people are or one of my friend
instead of one of my friends. These
errors are typical for intermediate
speakers. Try to self-correct if you
catch yourself making them. Speaking of
self-correcting, it's actually fine to
correct yourself if you make a small
mistake. It shows the examiner you
notice the error, like she have, sorry,
she has a lot of influence. Just don't
do it for every sentence or it breaks
fluency. But an occasional
self-correction is okay. Good point.
It's all about balance. Showcasing
grammar range, but maintaining fluency.
If grammar isn't your strongest point,
prioritize clarity first. Don't speak in
broken complex sentences. Better a
simple, correct sentence than a complex,
incorrect one that confuses meaning.
Now, pronunciation, the final piece.
Pronunciation is not about accent. As we
mentioned, you can have any accent and
still get band 9 if your pronunciation
is clear and easy to understand. They
assess things like clarity of sounds. Do
you say rice versus lice distinctly? If
those are an issue in your first
language, for example, word stress, do
you say photograph versus photography
correctly? The stress changes. Sentence
stress and intonation. Does your voice
rise and fall naturally, or is it
monotone? Monotone speech can make it
harder to tell if you're asking a
question or finishing a sentence, etc.
So, intonation matters. Also, grouping
words into phrases with the right rhythm
helps. For instance, native speakers
don't say each word separately. Instead
of I have been living here for 5 years,
they naturally group and stress like
I've been living here for 5 years. The
stress might fall on five years or
living and other words are shorter. One
tip, listen and mimic. Listen to native
speakers, podcasts, movies, YouTube, and
shadow their speech. Try to imitate the
melody of their sentences. It's not
about imitating an accent, just the
flow. This can really improve your
pronunciation and also your listening
skills. Another tip for pronunciation,
record yourself speaking. We said this
on day seven prep, too. and listen back.
It might be cringy to hear yourself, but
you will catch if some words are
unclear. Maybe you drop endings, eg not
pronouncing the s in plurals or third
person singular verbs, or you realize
your tone is very flat. Once you know,
you can work on those. If you know you
have specific troublesome sounds,
practice them in common words. For
example, th sound as in think this. Many
learners pronounce think like sink or
tink. Place your tongue between your
teeth for thu. It feels awkward, but
that's the position. Versus w like very
well. Some might say very well or very
well. Exaggerate the lip teeth position
for V. Your top teeth on your bottom
lip. Endings. Practice words like
wanted. Finished. Ensure you pronounce
that ed or at least a t sound in casual
speech if it's a regular verb. Also word
stress in multi-llable words one
syllable is emphasized. For example, in
comfortable stress is on for. If someone
says come for table, it sounds off. If
you're not sure of stress, dictionaries
show it or you can listen to the word
pronounced online. But for IELTS, the
good news is they don't expect perfect
pronunciation of every word, just
overall understandable speech. So focus
on the key content words. One more
thing, don't speak too quietly. This is
a practical exam tip. If the examiner
can't hear you well, it could affect how
they perceive your pronunciation or
fluency. Speak at a clear volume. If
you're softspoken, practice projecting
your voice more. And if nerves make your
voice shaky, some breathing exercises
before the test can help. Take deep
breaths while waiting and remember to
exhale as you start speaking. It
naturally makes your voice steadier.
Good idea. Nerves can also make you
rush, which can slur pronunciation. So,
consciously start a bit slower if you
notice that, then settle into a normal
pace. All right, day six recap. For
grammar, use a variety of sentence
types, simple and complex. Show off a
conditional or a relative clause if you
can. Keep an eye on common errors.
Subject verb agreement, tenses,
articles. Accuracy is as important as
range. For pronunciation, aim for
clarity. Practice difficult words and
sounds. Use intonation and stress to
sound natural, not robotic. Don't worry
about having an accent. Focus on being
easy to understand. and speak at a clear
moderate pace with adequate volume. With
solid grammar and clear pronunciation,
you'll come across as a very competent
English speaker, which is exactly what
the examiner is looking for. Now, folks,
we have one last day, day seven, which
is about final practice and exam
strategy. You're almost at the finish
line of this 7-day plan. Let's power
through.
[Music]
Day seven, you made it. Today is the
final day of our plan. It's all about
consolidation and getting ready for the
actual exam. By now, if you've followed
along, you've practiced each part of the
test and honed various skills. So, what
should you do on this last day and on
the exam day itself? Two things, mock
test practice and mental preparation.
One, do a full mock speaking test. Treat
today as exam rehearsal. If possible,
get a friend, family member, or tutor to
act as the examiner. Have them ask you a
few part one questions. Give you a
random part two card and then some part
three questions. Simulate the 11 to 14
minute interview. If you don't have
someone to practice with, use your
phone. There are apps and websites with
IELTS speaking questions. Record
yourself responding to say four part one
questions. Then actually set a timer for
1 minute prep and 2 minute speaking for
part two. Then answer three four part
three questions. After doing this,
listen to the recording or ask your
practice partner for feedback. Check for
fluency. Did you hesitate a lot or use
too many fillers? Coherence. Did your
answers make logical sense and stay on
topic? Vocabulary. Did you use some
interesting words or idioms? Did you
repeat basic words too much? Grammar.
Any noticeable errors or could you have
used more complex structures?
Pronunciation. Were there words you
stumbled on or parts that were unclear?
If you identify any weak spots, you can
do a quick revision on day seven. For
example, if you realize you messed up
past tense consistently, maybe spend an
hour reviewing past tense conjugations
or practicing storytelling in past
tense. If you lacked good vocab for a
topic, note down a few words for that
topic. However, don't cram too
aggressively today. It's about review
and practice, not learning a hundred new
words. In fact, sometimes it's better to
consolidate what you already know,
right? Also, ensure you get a good
night's sleep before the exam day if
possible. Speaking test often requires
you to be alert and responsive. Being
exhausted can affect your fluency and
mental search for words. Now, let's talk
exam day strategies. Before the test, do
a light warm up in English. You might
have nobody to talk to on the way, but
you can talk to yourself. For example,
describe what you see on your way to the
test center in English or just do some
tongue twisters or read a short passage
out loud. Get your mouth and brain into
English mode. At the test center, you'll
probably wait a bit. Use that time to
relax. Some people like to chat with
other candidates. If that helps you
loosen up, go for it in English if you
can. If it makes you more nervous, then
maybe just do some breathing exercises
or listen to a pumpup song that relaxes
you. Entering the exam room. The
examiner will greet you. This is
technically before the test starts
scoring, but make sure to respond with a
polite good morning or hello. That
little bit can start you off on the
right foot mentally. Confirm your
identity documents, etc. During the
test, remember all the tips from each
day. Specifically for part one, smile,
be chatty, and straightforward. For part
two, take the prep time seriously, write
notes, and during your speech, if you
momentarily blank out, glance at your
notes to pick up again. For part three,
don't rush into an answer if you need a
second to think. It's okay to say, "Hm,
let me think about that for a second."
Keep eye contact with the examiner if in
person. If on video, look at the camera
occasionally. This isn't a score
criterion, but it helps you engage in a
conversation style and can boost your
confidence. If you don't understand a
question, ask. As we mentioned, you can
say, "I'm sorry, could you repeat the
question?" Or, "Could you please explain
what you mean by the examiner will
either repeat or rephrase." It's much
better to do this than to answer wrongly
or go off topic because you misheard. It
does not hurt your score to ask for
clarification once or twice. If you
realize you used the wrong word or made
a grammar mistake, a quick
self-correction is fine. Like in my
country there is many sorry there are
many people who and then just continue.
It shows presence of mind. Don't
memorize answers as we said day one. But
by exam day you might have some handy
phrases ready. Use them flexibly not
like a robot. The examiner might change
topic or throw an unexpected question.
Be ready to adapt. Trust your ability.
Good advice. Also, stay calm if you
stumble. Sometimes you might start a
sentence, then realize it's not going
the way you wanted. It's okay. You can
either finish it and then add where I
mean is and clarify or start again. Let
me rephrase that. It's all about
communicating clearly. And if you get a
topic you have zero ideas about, you can
be honest and imaginative. Example, to
be honest, I'm not very familiar with,
but I guess and then say something. The
examiners care about language, not the
factual accuracy, so you can even make
something up. If asked, "How has the
education system in your country changed
in the last 20 years?" and you have no
clue, you could still say, "I'm not
completely sure, but from what I've
heard, perhaps it's changed with more
technology in classrooms and a greater
emphasis on exams." It's better than
saying, "I don't know." Always attempt
an answer. Excellent. After the test,
there's nothing more you can do, so try
to relax. But I know we often replay
what we said. If you made a mistake,
don't beat yourself up. You likely did
much better than you think. Examiners
understand it's a performance under
pressure. True. And one awkward answer
or grammar slip doesn't ruin the whole
test. They assess your level over the
whole interview. So, focus on the
overall impression you give. Someone who
can communicate and keep a conversation
in English going. If you did that,
you're in good shape. Let's recap day
seven key points. Do a realistic mock
test practice to build confidence and
get used to the exam timing. On exam
day, warm up your English and arrive
prepared. Bring your ID, etc. Use
relaxation techniques to handle nerves,
deep breaths, positive self-t talk, even
some stretching if you need to loosen
tension. During the test, apply all the
strategies. Give developed answers.
Showcase vocab and grammar. Be clear in
pronunciation. And importantly, don't
panic if there's a hiccup. Recover and
continue. If aiming for band 9 sounds
intimidating, aim for doing your best.
This one intensive prep will definitely
bump up your performance. And even if
you land a band seven or eight, that's
still a fantastic result. Aim high and
you'll likely achieve higher than if you
stay cautious. And finally, believe in
yourself. Confidence can noticeably
improve how you speak. Even if you have
some mistakes, speaking confidently can
sometimes make those less significant.
The examiner might subconsciously think,
"This person communicates really well,
and the small errors won't weigh as
heavily." Well said. All right, that
wraps up our 7-day rapid IELTS speaking
success plan. Congratulations on
sticking with us through the week. We
covered a lot from answering simple
questions about yourself to discussing
big ideas in part three, plus
vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, all
the ingredients for a high band score.
We hope you found this helpful, and even
more, we hope you feel more confident
going into your IEL speaking test.
You've got a toolkit of tips and
examples now. Make sure to practice them
on your own. Remember, improvement comes
with practice. This 7-day guide is
intense, but you can always repeat
exercises, revisit difficult questions,
and keep refining your skills beyond
this week. Exactly. And if your test is
very soon, we wish you the best of luck.
Actually, there's an English idiom we
taught earlier, break a leg, which means
good luck. So, break a leg on your IELTS
test. Not literally, of course. Just do
great. You've got this. Before we sign

and good luck.
Hello and welcome to the English Phrases
Hub podcast. I'm Emma and I'm here with
my awesome co-host Jake. Hey there
listeners. I'm Jake. Thanks for joining
us today. Emma, I am so excited for
today's episode. It's all about one of
my favorite topics in language learning.
Mine too. Today we're diving into
discover the listening strategies for
better English learning. So, if you're
learning English, whether you're a
beginner or advanced, we've got some
great tips to help you understand spoken
English better. That's right. We'll
cover a bunch of practical listening
strategies. I think we have 10 lined up,
right? Yep. Around 10 strategies,
including things like chunking,
shadowing, using subtitles, predictive
listening, and a lot more. And don't
worry, we'll explain what all of those
fancy terms mean in a fun, simple way.
Plus, you know us, we'll throw in a
touch of humor along the way. Learning
should be fun. Absolutely. Whether
you're just starting out with English or
you're preparing for advanced exams,
these techniques can make a huge
difference. I remember when I started
learning Spanish, I was lost in
conversations until I tried some of
these strategies. That's a great point.
We're not just hosts. We've been
language learners ourselves. So, we know
the struggle. All right, let's get
started with our first listening
strategy. First up, chunking. Now,
chunking might sound like what happens
when I eat ice cream too fast. Chunky
monkey, anyone?
Not that kind of chunk, Jake. In
language learning, chunking means
breaking what you hear into phrases or
chunks of words rather than trying to
catch one word at a time. It's a way to
help your brain process English in
meaningful blocks. Right? Instead of
hearing a rapid stream of words and
panicking, you divide the sentence into
smaller pieces that make sense. Kind of
like separating a big cake into
bite-sized slices. M cake. Learning
English is delicious. Focus, Jake. For
example, let's take the sentence, I'm
going to the store to buy some milk. If
you listen for each individual word, you
might get hung up on a word you don't
know or how fast it is. But if you chunk
it, you can break it into pieces. I'm
going to the store to buy some milk.
Exactly. Two chunks. I'm going to the
store and to buy some milk. Your brain
can handle that much more easily than
seven separate words. And chunking is
great because native speakers actually
speak in chunks. They naturally group
words together, like going to the store
said quickly, almost like one phrase. If
you train yourself to catch phrases,
you'll understand sentences even when
spoken fast. Here's a quick exercise.
I'll say a sentence and you try to chunk
it, Emma. Ready? Let's do it.
Learning English with podcasts is both
fun and effective. Okay, I chunk that as
learning English with podcasts is both
fun and effective. Four chunks. Great
job. Notice I paused slightly at each
break when I repeated it. Listeners, you
can do this too. When you listen to
English, maybe a YouTube video or our
podcast, try to hear the small pauses or
rhythm where words group naturally.
Those are your chunks. For beginners,
start with short sentences or simple
dialogues. Write them down and draw
slashes between chunks. For more
advanced learners, you can try chunking
in real time as you listen to native
level content. It takes practice, but it
really boosts comprehension. And don't
stress if you miss a word. If you get
the chunk, you often get the meaning.
Like maybe you missed the word milk in
our example, but you caught buy
something at the store. You can guess
it's probably groceries, milk, etc.
Exactly. Chunking pairs well with using
context, which we'll talk about a bit
later. But the main idea, listen for
groups of words, not just single words.
It'll make understanding English much
smoother and hopefully sweeter, like
chunks of chocolate in your ice cream.
Couldn't resist. Oh, Jake. All right, I
think that covers chunking. Ready to
move on? You bet. On to strategy number
two. Our second strategy is shadowing.
This is one of my personal favorites.
Shadowing means listening to speech and
repeating it immediately like an echo or
a shadow of the speaker. It's basically
you being the speaker's shadow. Imagine
the speaker is Peter Pan and you're his
shadow, trying to mimic everything he
does. Shadowing minus the mischief,
hopefully. Shadowing is a fantastic
exercise because it forces you to really
listen. You have to pay super close
attention to pronunciation, intonation,
the up and down of the voice, and rhythm
so you can repeat it correctly. It's
great for listening and speaking
practice at the same time. It might feel
a bit weird at first talking to your
screen or your phone, but trust us, it
works. For example, if you're watching
an English video or listening to a
podcast, you can try shadowing a few
sentences. Just be sure to pause or
choose something where the speaker
leaves little gaps. Actually, let's
demonstrate a tiny example. I'll say a
short phrase and you try to shadow me,
Jake. Ready? Ready. Shadow mode on.
It's important to practice every day.
It's important to practice every day.
Perfect. You even matched my intonation.
How did that feel? I felt like your
echo. Kind of fun. I have to really
focus on every sound you made. I noticed
the way you linked practice and every
smoothly. And that's the point. When you
shadow, you notice details in
pronunciation that you might miss if
you're just passively listening. It can
improve your listening comprehension and
your accent because you're training your
mouth and ears at the same time. Pro
tip, start with something slow or with
clear pronunciation. You could use
educational videos where speakers
articulate well or even better use the
transcript or subtitle while shadowing
if available at least on your first try.
Yes, many learners use apps or YouTube
for this. For instance, find an English
learning video or even a scene from a TV
show on YouTube. Slow it down to 0.75x
speed if needed. Listen and repeat right
after each sentence. Then try it at
normal speed. You'll feel a bit like a
parrot at first. Polly wants a cracker,
but over time you'll catch words faster
and understand native speech much
better. One thing, don't worry if you
can't shadow everything perfectly. Even
catching and repeating 50% of it is good
practice. You can always pause, rewind,
and try again. The key is consistency
and not being shy to speak up. And if
someone walks in while you're shadowing
and wonders why you're talking to
yourself, just tell them you're
practicing your future voice acting
career. Or better yet, invite them to
join. There you go. Make it a group
activity. The bottom line, shadowing is
a powerful way to sharpen your
listening. It makes you actively engage
with what you hear. And honestly, it can
be pretty fun mimicking movie lines or
your favorite actors. Just maybe don't
shadow the bad words you hear in movies.
Shadow the good stuff. Good advice,
Jake. All right, let's move on to our
next strategy. Strategy number three is
using subtitles or transcripts while
listening. This one's a bit
controversial in the language learning
world. Some people swear by subtitles,
others say turn them off. So, what's our
take? I'd say use subtitles wisely. For
beginners, subtitles in English, not
your native language, can be incredibly
helpful. They let you read along while
you listen, which can help you match
spoken words to written words. It's like
training wheels on a bicycle. Exactly.
If you're a beginner or watching content
that's above your level, turning on
English subtitles can help you not miss
important info. For example, maybe
you're watching an English YouTube
lesson or a TV show. With subtitles,
you'll catch new vocabulary and see
spelling. And even for intermediate
learners, subtitles or transcripts can
be useful for studying. One technique,
first listen without subtitles and see
how much you understand. Then listen
again with subtitles or read the
transcript to catch what you missed.
Yes. That way you get the best of both.
You challenge your ears and then you
verify with text. For instance, say I
listen to a news podcast and I
understood roughly 70%. Later, I read
the transcript and find I missed a
phrase like economic downturn. Seeing it
written, I go, "Aha, that's what they
said." A quick example. Let's imagine a
short clip. No subtitles first. The
scientists revolutionized the field with
their discovery. Now, if I'm listening
and I'm not sure what that long word
was, something like rev what? I might be
lost. Then I check subtitles or
transcript and see the word
revolutionized, right? And then you
might think, "Oh, I know the word
revolution. Maybe revolutionize means to
completely change something. You've
learned a new word and next time you
hear it, you'll recognize it." However,
here's a caution. Try not to become too
dependent on subtitles. If you always
watch with subtitles on, you might find
that the minute they're off, you feel
lost again. It's like always using those
training wheels and never taking them
off. Exactly. As you get more advanced,
challenge yourself to go without
subtitles more often. Maybe turn them
off for easier content or switch to
English subtitles if you were using your
native language subtitles before.
Another tip, there are tools and browser
extensions out there that let you
display subtitles in two languages at
once or click a word to translate it.
Those can be useful for learning, but
again, balance is key. Also, consider
using transcripts after listening. For
example, many podcasts, including ours,
have transcripts. You could listen to an
episode, then read the transcript to
fill in gaps in your understanding and
even highlight words to look up later. I
used to print out song lyrics and read
them while listening. It helped me
finally figure out those mumbled lines
in pop songs that I could never catch.
Blah blah like a broken straw. Wait,
those weren't the lyrics. Let me guess,
you learned the real lyrics after seeing
them written. Yes, and I was way off.
The real line was like a rolling stone,
not broken straw. Who knew? That's a
great example of how reading along can
correct misunderstandings. So, to sum
up, use subtitles or transcripts as a
learning tool. They're especially great
for discovering new vocabulary and
training your ear, but also practice
without them to build your independent
listening skills. And if you catch
yourself only reading and not listening,
maybe hit that hide subtitles button for
a while and test your ears. Remember,
the goal is to understand the spoken
English in real time eventually. Well
said. Ready for the next strategy? Yep.
This next one is a fun mental exercise.
Strategy four is predictive listening.
Essentially guessing what comes next
while you listen. Now, you might already
do this in your native language without
thinking about it. It's like being a
fortune teller for conversations. I
predict you will love this technique.
But seriously, predictive listening
means using context clues and your
knowledge of language patterns to
anticipate what the speaker is going to
say or the general direction of the
talk. Why do this? Well, it keeps you
actively engaged and helps you not miss
information. If you're anticipating,
you're less likely to be caught off
guard. And if you guess right, it boosts
your confidence. If you guess wrong, it
can actually highlight where you need to
pay more attention. Let's try a simple
example. If I start a sentence with,
today I want to talk about the three
main reasons. What do you predict will
come next? I'd expect you to list
something like first reason, second
reason, third reason. My brain is
already getting ready to hear a list of
three things. Exactly. Certain phrases
set you up to predict what's next. First
of all usually means a sequence will
follow. Secondly, thirdly, and so on. If
someone asks why did, you can predict
they're expecting a reason or
explanation in the answer. Another
example, say you're listening to a story
and you hear suddenly the door creaked
open and you might predict that
something or someone surprising enters
because that's a common pattern in
stories. In everyday conversations, you
do it too. Like if you hear, "Can you
tell me the directions to?" You can
guess the person is asking for a
location or how to go somewhere. Even if
you didn't catch the place name, you
know they're asking for directions. This
skill is super useful in tests like
IELTS or TOEFL listening as well, where
you can often guess what type of
information is coming, a number, a name,
etc. from the question prompts. But for
daily listening, it just means staying
on your toes. One way to practice
predictive listening is to listen to
short audio clips or dialogues and pause
before something happens. Then think,
what do I think they'll say next? For
beginners, this might be predicting a
single word or an answer. For advanced
folks, you might predict the next
sentence or idea. Want to try a quick
fun predictive game here? Sure. I'll
start a sentence and you finish it with
a logical ending. Ready? If you practice
listening every day for a month, I
predict that.
Or maybe you'll start dreaming in
English. Both could be true. Great
predictions. My crystal ball says
consistent practice definitely leads to
progress. The point is by guessing what
comes next, you stay engaged. And even
if your prediction is a little silly,
like dreaming in English, it makes the
activity more fun and keeps your brain
active. Also, when you guess wrong, pay
attention to why. Did you mishar
something earlier? Was there a
vocabulary word that threw you off?
That's a clue to what you might need to
study or listen for. Exactly. Predictive
listening is like having a mini
conversation in your head with the
speaker. You're not just a passive
receiver. you're interacting with the
content. And if you practice this soon,
you'll notice you can follow complex
talks or fast speakers much better
because your brain is always a step
ahead catching clues. All right, from
predicting the future, let's move to
another related strategy, using context
clues. Strategy five is using context
clues to understand what you missed.
This goes handinhand with predictive
listening, but let's break it down.
Using context clues means figuring out
the meaning of unknown words or phrases
from the surrounding information.
Basically, you Sherlock Holmes your way
through the sentence. Exactly. Think of
yourself as a detective. If you miss a
word, you look for clues in what was
said before and after, in the situation,
or even in the speaker's tone to deduce
what that word might mean or what's
happening. For example, say you hear, "I
brought my umbrella because it was
drizzling." Now, imagine you don't know
the word umbrella. From context, you
heard because it was drizzling.
Drizzling means raining lightly. So,
what do people usually bring when it's
raining? Probably an umbrella. So, even
if you missed that word, you could guess
umbrella or at least understand, I
brought something because it was
raining. The context gives you the
general idea. Here's a fun mini
dialogue. Let's say, uh, my boss was so
I rateate this morning. Oh no, what
happened? Why was she so angry? Now, if
you didn't know, I rate my response uses
the word angry, which basically gives
away the meaning. Context clue achieved.
Yes. Sometimes the conversation partner
will naturally restate the idea in
simpler words, as you just did, or other
context clues. Maybe my tone of voice
sounded upset or I sighed. Clues that I
rate was something negative about my
boss. Context clues aren't just verbal.
They can be situational. If you're
listening to someone describe a vehicle
and they mention wheels, seats, and an
engine, you figure out they're talking
about a car or some mode of transport,
even if the word vehicle was new to you.
For beginners, using context is
essential because you won't know every
word. And that's okay. Train yourself to
keep listening even when a word flies
over your head. Don't panic and stop
listening. Instead, focus on the words
you do understand and the overall
situation. A common beginner mistake is
hearing an unknown word and freezing up,
thinking, "I didn't get that word. I'm
lost." Meanwhile, the speaker has moved
on and you miss the next part, too. It's
like tripping over a pebble because you
stopped walking, right? Instead, let the
unknown word go for a moment and use the
rest of the sentence to guess. Often the
meaning will become clear later, and if
not, you can always look it up after,
but at least you'll keep understanding
the general idea. For intermediate and
advanced learners, context clues help
with idioms or cultural references, too.
Like if someone says, "It's raining cats
and dogs," and you've never heard that,
you might think, "Huh?" But if they then
say, "I got completely soaked walking
home." You use context to realize
raining cats and dogs means raining
heavily. Exactly. English has lots of
idiomatic expressions, and context is
your best friend for those. One more
tip, pay attention to tone of voice and
facial expressions. If you can see the
speaker, like in a video, they often
give context. If someone sounds excited
and you missed a word, you can infer
it's something good. If they sound sad,
the missing word was probably something
bad or unfortunate. Good point. Tone can
clue you in on whether the news is
positive or negative, even if specific
words escape you. So, be a word
detective. Use clues from everywhere,
other words you understand, the
situation, tone, even background sounds
to fill in the blanks in your mind. And
hey, sometimes you'll guess wrong. It's
part of learning. I once heard, "We had
a blast at the party when I was a
learner and thought something
exploded because blast I knew as an
explosion, but the laughter and happy
voices clued me in, but it actually
meant they had a lot of fun." Oh wow,
that's a great example. Context saved
the day. Otherwise, you'd think they
barely survived a party gone wrong.
Thankfully, I picked up on the right
meaning. So, trust yourself and the
context. You know more than you think.
All right, on to our next strategy. What
do we have for number six? Number six is
learning to listen differently for the
gist versus details. In other words,
sometimes you listen for the big picture
and other times you listen for the tiny
pieces of information. Both are
important skills. Think of it like using
a camera. Sometimes you want the wide
angle shot. That's the gist. And
sometimes you zoom in on a specific
object. That's details. Exactly.
Listening for gist means you're trying
to get the general understanding of
what's being said without worrying about
every single word. This is especially
useful on a first listen or if the audio
is above your level. You ask yourself
overall, what are they talking about?
What's the main idea or the main story
here? For example, say you're listening
to a short news report in English. If
you're listening for gist, you focus on
understanding the core of the story.
Maybe it's about a new policy, an event
that happened, or a celebrity doing
something funny. You might catch only a
few key words like election, new
president, 55% of voters, and you did
this. Ah, they're talking about election
results. Listening for detail, on the
other hand, is when you're trying to
catch specific pieces of information,
numbers, names, dates, or a particular
fact. This usually comes after you know
the gist or when you have a specific
question to answer. So, with that same
news report, once you know it's about an
election result, you might listen again
for details like what percentage of
people voted for the winner? What's the
new president's name? Which regions had
the highest turnout? Those are detail
questions. A practical way to use this
strategy, separate your listening into
two rounds. First, listen to understand
the general idea and don't pause or
stress about what you miss. After that,
listen a second time or a third to pick
up the details you want or to clarify
things you weren't sure about. This
approach really helps because it takes
the pressure off. You give yourself
permission not to catch everything at
first. You focus on understanding the
story or conversation in broad strokes.
Then you go back and refine your
understanding with details. Yes. And it
mirrors real life, too. Often in a first
listen, even native speakers don't
memorize every detail. They just get the
gist. We often ask, "Wait, what was that
deed again?" and listen again or ask
again for the detail. For learners, one
trick is to actually write down or say
out loud a one-s sentence summary after
your first listen. For example, okay,
this audio was about a new cafe opening
in the city center. Then on second
listen, aim to catch the cafe's name,
opening date, what makes it special, and
so on. Great tip. And if you're in a
test situation like TOEFL or IELTS
listening, usually you'll know what kind
of details you need because of the
questions. So you get the gist first,
then zero in on answers. But in everyday
learning, you can simulate this by
making your own questions. Like if
you're listening to a podcast episode,
first get the gist of each section. Then
challenge yourself. Can I catch the name
of the book they mentioned or the three
reasons they gave for X? Listen again
for those. This can also highlight any
listening weaknesses. If you got the
gist but always miss numbers or names,
maybe you need to practice listening to
numbers. Some people struggle with
hearing 13 versus 30, for instance, or
common names in English. True. I used to
always mix teen numbers versus 10. 14
versus 40, 15 versus 50 until I
practiced with audio recordings of
numbers. It's a detail thing. One more
thing, when listening for detail, if
it's something super important and you
didn't catch it, don't be afraid to
rewind or ask someone to repeat if
you're in a conversation. It's normal.
But do try to hone those ears so you can
catch details on the fly over time. So
remember, sometimes zoom out, big
picture, sometimes zoom in, specifics.
Both modes of listening are useful.
Mastering switching between them will
make you a more effective listener.
Absolutely. All right, on to strategy
number seven, which is closely related.
Repetition and replay. Our seventh
strategy is all about the power of
repetition. listening to things more
than once and using that rewind button
liberally. In short, don't one and done
your listening practice. Replaying audio
can massively improve comprehension. I
love this one because it's so simple.
Just listen again. We kind of hinted at
it with gist versus detail, but let's
expand. Every time you relisten to the
same piece of English audio, you'll
notice you understand a little more.
It's like peeling an onion layer by
layer without the tears.
Sometimes with tears if it's a sad
story, but
yes. For example, think about your
favorite movie or TV show in English.
The first time you watched it, maybe you
understood, say, 60%. The second time,
you already know the plot. So you can
pay attention to different things and
maybe you catch 80%. Third time you're
noticing even the jokes or subtle
details you missed. Exactly. Repetition
builds familiarity. Your ear starts
recognizing phrases that flew by before.
Plus knowing the context from the first
listen helps the second listen make more
sense. A good technique is listen,
repeat, recall. Listen to an audio once,
then pause and see what you recall or
understood. Then listen again and see
what you missed. You'll often realize
that some parts that sounded like
gibberish the first time are clearer the
second time. I actually do this with
podcasts in Spanish. The first time I
might not catch a particular phrase, but
when I replay I'm like, "Oh, that's what
they said." It's a satisfying feeling,
like solving a little puzzle. And if
there's a part you really can't catch,
don't be afraid to rewind and play that
snippet a few times. Sometimes hearing
that 5-second segment three or four
times may be slowing it down. Suddenly,
your brain clicks and you hear the word
correctly. Also, many apps and players
let you slow down the audio to 0.5x or
0.75x. It might sound a bit funny, but
it can help with really fast talkers.
Then you can gradually increase the
speed as you get comfortable. And
repetition doesn't have to be backto
back like a broken record. You could
listen to something today, then again
tomorrow or next week. Spaced repetition
works for listening, too. Revisiting an
old audio after some time can reinforce
what you learned and show you how much
more you understand. Now, oh, quick
story. I once listened to a comedy
podcast and totally missed the punchline
of a joke because they spoke so fast. I
laughed along like, "Huh?" Feeling
clueless. Later, I replayed that bit,
slowed it down, and finally got the
joke. I literally laughed out loud alone
in my car when it finally clicked.
That's the best when you catch it and it
becomes genuinely funny. And hey, that's
motivating. It made you want to listen
more, right? Definitely. I didn't mind
listening multiple times because the
content was enjoyable. That's another
point. Choose interesting stuff to
listen to. More on that soon. So that
repetition isn't boring. Good segue,
Jake. But just to wrap up repetition,
make it a habit to listen at least twice
to your practice materials. The first
round is for familiarity. The second or
third is for depth. Each pass, you'll
pick up something new, like layers of a
painting becoming clearer. And
gradually, you'll need fewer replays to
understand. That's the progress
happening. All right. Shall we talk
about that interesting content part?
Yes, that'll be covered in strategy 9.
But before that, let's cover one more
active listening method, note-taking and
summarizing. Strategy eight is note
takingaking and summarizing. turning
your listening practice into an active
output exercise. Now, this might sound
like homework, but it can actually be
pretty engaging and very effective.
Basically, after or during listening,
you write down key points or a summary
of what you heard. It forces you to
process and remember the information.
And if you missed something, you'll
realize it when you try to summarize,
which is great feedback for what to
improve.
Exactly. For example, suppose you just
listened to a 5-inute English news
podcast. Now, challenge yourself. Write
a short summary of it in English. It
could even be a few bullet points. Or if
writing feels too slow, just pause and
say out loud what the story was about in
your own words. This does a few things.
One, it checks your understanding. Can
you accurately describe what you heard?
Two, it highlights any gaps. Maybe you
realize, "I don't actually know why the
guy went to jail in the story. I missed
that detail." So, you can listen again
for that. Three, it helps transfer new
words or phrases from short-term to
long-term memory because you're actively
using them. When I was training in
French, I used to keep a little
listening journal. I'd listen to a short
radio piece, then jot down the date, the
topic, a few new words I heard, and a
couple of sentences. It was satisfying
to look back and see my notes become
more detailed over time as my listening
improved. That's a great idea. And
note-taking doesn't have to be full
sentences if that's too hard at first.
You can jot down key words while
listening. Like if you're listening to a
lecture or TED talk, maybe you write
down climate change, two degrees,
policy, renewable energy to help you
remember the key points. Exactly.
Whatever helps you capture the info.
Some people draw little mind maps or
doodles associated with what they heard.
That's fine, too. It's your notes. No
one else has to read them. So, do what
works for you. Also, if you're in a
situation where you can't take notes,
like listening while driving or walking,
you can do a mental summary or record a
voice memo for yourself afterwards. Even
thinking through the summary in your
head is better than nothing. For
advanced learners, summarizing can be in
English to practice output or even in
your native language if your goal is
purely comprehension. But I recommend
trying in English because it practices
paraphrasing skills, too. Here's a fun
practice idea. After watching an English
movie or episode, try giving your friend
a recap in English or even talk to
yourself if no one's around. Pretend
you're doing a short review of it. It's
casual and you might even use some of
the phrases you picked up. Yes, Jake and
I actually do that sometimes with shows
we both watch. We'll chat about it in
English, effectively summarizing parts
of it and reacting. It definitely helps
reinforce what we heard. And don't worry
if your summary isn't perfect. The goal
isn't to write a school essay. It's just
to engage with the material. If you
realized you couldn't summarize it at
all, that's a sign it was too hard or
you need to relisten with a different
strategy. Maybe you need subtitles or to
chunk it out. One more angle, note
takingaking during listening. If you're
doing a longer listen, like a 30inut
podcast or lecture, practice scribbling
quick notes as you listen in real time.
This can train you to pick out key words
on the fly. It's challenging but useful,
especially for academic listening. True.
Start with something shorter, like a
5-minut segment, and see if you can
catch the main points in notes. Over
time, you'll get better at writing one
thing while still hearing the next
thing. A skill that really helps in
meetings or classes in English. Great.
Summarizing and note-taking might sound
like extra work, but they do wonders for
solidifying your listening
comprehension. Give it a try, even just
once a week, with a podcast episode or
news report. All right, now let's move
to a more fun strategy, one that keeps
you interested and prevents boredom.
Strategy nine, mix it up and have fun
with your listening practice. In other
words, variety is your friend. Don't
just listen to one kind of material.
Explore different types of content and
find things you genuinely enjoy. Yes, if
you enjoy what you're listening to,
you'll be more engaged and you'll
naturally pay closer attention and
you'll stick with it longer. So, if you
love music, use music. If you love
sports, find sports commentary or
podcasts. If you're into cooking, watch
recipe videos in English. There's
something for everyone. Also, variety in
formats and accents is great, especially
as you get more confident. Try podcasts,
YouTube videos, TV shows, movies, audio
books, radio, even Tik Tok videos of
people speaking English. Each format can
train your ear in different ways. For
example, podcasts and audiobooks are
purely audio. So, they force you to rely
100% on listening. Great training. TV
shows or YouTube might give you visuals
and body language cues. Songs help you
catch words in a rhythmic context.
Mixing them keeps your brain on its
toes. And accents, don't be afraid of
different English accents once you have
the basics down. English is spoken in so
many ways. American, British,
Australian, Canadian, Indian, and more.
The more varieties you listen to, the
more adaptable your ear becomes. Start
with a clear accent that you find
easiest, then branch out. I remember the
first time I watched a British period
drama, I had to really concentrate
because I was used to American accents.
But after a few episodes, it got easier.
Then Australian English threw me for a
loop for a bit. Now it's actually fun to
identify where an accent is from. Yeah,
at first it might be tough, but then it
becomes like a superpower. Oh, I can
understand this Scottish YouTuber now.
It feels rewarding. Another aspect of
variety is topics. Listening to a wide
range of topics will expose you to
different vocabulary. Don't just stick
to one subject. If you always listen to,
say, tech podcasts, you'll be great with
tech terms, but maybe struggle if
someone starts talking about cooking.
So, mix topics, news, everyday
conversations, academic talks, casual
chats. Also include some just for fun
listening. Everything doesn't have to be
study, study, study. Watching a comedy
show or YouTuber you like in English
totally counts as listening practice.
Even if you don't understand every joke,
you're still training your ear and
enjoying yourself. Exactly. Enjoyment
matters because listening practice isn't
just a one-day thing. It's ongoing. So
if you hate what you're listening to,
you won't keep it up. Find content that
makes you forget you're practicing
English at all. One thing I did was
follow English-speaking influencers and
content creators on social media. So,
when I scrolled Instagram or Tik Tok,
I'd naturally encounter English content
about topics I like. Travel, comedy,
science facts, whatever. Those
bite-sized videos can be great casual
listening practice. Great idea. And
those often come with subtitles, too,
which can help, as we discussed earlier.
Just be careful to balance it. If you
only listen to say one YouTuber who
talks in a very particular way, you
might get used to just that style.
That's why we say mix it up. Yes,
diversify your listening diet. It's like
nutrition. A balanced diet makes a
healthy listener. And if you find
something too hard or boring, drop it
and try something else. There's no rule
that you must finish a podcast episode
if you're not enjoying it or it's way
over your head. Keep it challenging but
not overwhelming and definitely fun.
Couldn't agree more. Now, we've got one
last strategy which ties everything
together. Last, but absolutely not
least, strategy 10 is consistent
practice and patience. This is more of a
mindset and approach than a technique,
but it's crucial for success in
improving your listening. We couldn't
end without this one. The truth is,
getting better at listening in English
or any language takes time and regular
practice. There's no magic overnight
fix. But the good news is every little
bit of practice adds up and you will see
improvement if you stick with it.
Exactly. Consistency means, for example,
setting aside a bit of time each day or
several times a week for focused
listening practice. It doesn't have to
be long. Even 15, 20 minutes a day can
be more effective than a 3hour binge
once a month. Kind of like exercise.
Better to do a little jog every day,
then run a marathon once in a blue moon,
and then collapse. Your listening muscle
grows with regular workouts. And along
with consistency comes patience. In the
beginning, it might feel like you're not
catching much. But if you compare your
understanding after, say, 3 months of
study practice to when you started,
you'll likely notice a big difference.
Celebrate those small victories. Maybe
today you understood an entire song
chorus without looking up the lyrics.
That's awesome. or you watched a short
video and got the joke without
subtitles. High five. Those little
milestones show you that you're
improving. Also, don't be discouraged by
bad listening days. We all have days
when our brain is tired or the speaker
is unusually hard to understand. It
doesn't mean you're failing. Just take a
break and come back later. Yes, I still
sometimes listen to something and think,
"What on earth did they just say?"
Especially if it's a heavy accent or
noisy background. It happens. Instead of
letting it frustrate you, use it as
motivation to keep practicing. Another
part of patience is being kind to
yourself. Don't expect to understand
100% of everything, even at advanced
levels. Native speakers don't catch
everything either. Believe it or not, we
ask pardon or could you repeat that,
too? That's so true. How many times have
I asked my English-eaking friends, "Huh,
what was that name?" when listening to a
story. Plenty. So, be patient and
persistent. Make listening a habit, like
while you have your morning coffee or
during your commute or in the evening
winding down, and stick with it. One
idea, keep a little log of your
practice. Noting down dates and what you
listen to can show you how consistent
you've been and maybe rate how much you
understood. Over time, you'll see those
ratings go up, which feels great.
Ultimately, improvement in listening is
a gradual climb, but each of the
strategies we discussed will speed up
that journey, and consistent practice is
the glue that holds all those strategies
together. Well said. So folks, remember
a little listening every day. Try
different strategies and be patient with
yourself. You'll get there step by step.
And with that, we've covered all 10
strategies. What do you say we wrap up
and remind everyone of what we went
through? Good idea. So, let's quickly
recap the listening strategies we
discussed today. We started with
chunking, breaking speech into phrases.
Then shadowing, repeating what you hear
to sharpen your ear, using subtitles or
transcripts wisely, predictive
listening, anticipating what comes next,
and using context clues, deducing
meaning from situation and surrounding
words. Then we talked about listening
for gist versus detail. Big picture
first, details second. The power of
repetition and replaying audio,
note-taking and summarizing to engage
actively with what you hear. Variety and
fun content to keep yourself interested
and expose your ears to different
sounds. And finally, consistent practice
with patience because improvement takes
time, but it does happen. Wow, we really
packed a lot in this episode. I hope you
all found these strategies useful and
maybe had a laugh or two along the way.
Remember, you don't have to implement
all 10 strategies at once. Try a couple
that sound fun to you. Maybe this week,
experiment with shadowing a YouTube
video and using subtitles for a tough TV
show. Next week, try note-taking on a
podcast. Step by step. Exactly. And let
us know how it goes. We'd love to hear
about your experiences. If you have any
cool listening tips of your own or funny

Hello and welcome to English Phrases Hub
podcast, the podcast where we tackle
advanced English topics to boost your
professional fluency. I'm Emma. And I'm
Jack. And today we've got a fun and
incredibly useful episode lined up. 50
business idioms you need to know for
advanced English. Why 50 idioms? Well,
if you've ever been in a meeting and
someone said, "Let's cut to the chase,"
or, "Keep me in the loop," and you found
yourself puzzled, you're not alone.
Business English is full of these
colorful phrases that can leave even
fluent speakers scratching their heads.
In this episode, we're going to
demystify 50 of the most essential
idioms that you'll hear in offices,
boardrooms, and even those casual coffee
machine chats all the time. and we've
organized them into handy categories
from money talk and finance to office
teamwork to strategy and more so you can
grasp them in context. By the end of the
show, you'll not only understand what
the ball is in your court means, but
you'll also feel confident using these
phrases in your own conversations at
work. So, grab a cup of coffee or tea
and let's dive in. Oh, and don't worry
about memorizing everything at once.
We'll review key points and you can
always revisit the episode. Also, check
out the worksheet linked in the
description. It includes a full list of
all 50 idioms, real business examples,
practice exercises to help you
understand and use them, discussion and
writing tasks to build your confidence.
Ready? Let's get down to business. See
what I did there? Love it. Let's go.
Our first set of idioms is all about
money because in business, well, we talk
about money a lot. Yep. And
understanding finance idioms will really
help you follow discussions about
profits, costs, and investments. So,
let's jump in with our money matters.
First up, break even. This is what every
business hopes to do in the beginning.
To break even means to neither make a
profit nor incur a loss. In other words,
you've made back what you spent. For
example, after 6 months, our new store
is finally breaking even. We're not
losing money anymore. Yay. But we're
also not making a profit yet. Breaking
is often the first big milestone for a
startup. Next, in the red versus in the
black. These color idioms come straight
from accounting. Being in the red means
you're losing money. Think of red ink
showing negative balances. And being in
the black means you're profitable. Back
when accountants used black ink for
positive numbers. So if someone says,
"We've been in the red all year," that's
a warning sign. The company has been
operating at a loss. On the bright side,
last quarter we got back in the black.
Now they're profitable again. Bottom
line, you definitely want your business
in the black, not in the red. How about
cash cow? One of my favorites. No actual
cows involved. Promise. A cash cow is a
product or service that consistently
makes a lot of money. It's like the
steady cow you can keep milking profits
from. For example, our software
subscription is a real cash cow. It
brings in steady revenue every month.
Companies love cash cows because they
can rely on them financially and often
use that income to fund new innovations
or cover other losses. Now, deep
pockets. If a person or a business has
deep pockets, it means they have a lot
of money or financial resources. Just
imagine reaching deep into your pocket
and finding endless cash. You might hear
to launch this project, we need an
investor with deep pockets. It usually
implies the project is costly and
requires someone rich or a company that
can spend big. If someone has deep
pockets, they can afford big investments
or can survive financial losses more
easily. Next up, a startup favorite,
burn rate. Burn rate is how quickly a
company is spending its cash, usually
measured per month. Think of cash as
fuel. How fast are you burning through
it? For example, our burn rate is 50K a
month. That means every month the
company is spending that amount, often
venture capital money, to keep going.
It's crucial for businesses to watch
their burn rate because if you burn
money faster than you make revenue,
well, you'll run out of fuel. I like to
say at our current burn rate, we have
six months of runway left unless we
start making more sales or cut costs.
And finally, for this set, crunch the
numbers. When you crunch the numbers,
you're doing the math or analyzing data
in detail. It's what finance teams and
analysts do all the time. For example,
let's crunch the numbers on our Q4
expenses. That means let's dig into the
spreadsheets and calculate exactly what
happened. I like this idiom because you
can almost picture chewing through a big
pile of numbers. It's a fun casual way
to say do the calculations. Sounds much
cooler, right? Definitely cooler. All
right, that's our first set. Money and
finance idioms. And there are plenty
more to come. Ready for the next
category? Let's
go. Quick check-in. Still with us? We've
covered a few heavy finance terms, but
hang in there. These are super useful.
Let's do a couple more money idioms.
Ready? First up, bang for your buck.
Everyone wants more bang for their buck.
This means getting good value for the
money you spend. Literally, a big bang
result for your buck dollar. If I say we
chose online ads because they give us
more bang for our buck, I mean they have
better results for the cost compared to
other methods. It's an idiom you'll hear
often when people are talking about
maximizing value or ROI, return on
investment.
And really, who doesn't want more value,
right? Next cost an arm and a leg. If
something costs an arm and a leg, it's
ridiculously expensive. Of course, we're
not paying with limbs. It's a humorous
way to exaggerate price. For example,
the new office chairs cost an arm and a
leg, meaning they were very pricey.
You'll often hear this idiom used in a
complaining or joking way about high
prices, like, "Don't break that laptop.
It cost me an arm and a leg."
It really adds color to your language
instead of just saying very expensive.
Now, foot the bill. Here's one where
foot isn't about your foot at all. To
foot the bill means to pay for
something, especially if it's a large
expense. Often, it's used when one party
takes on the cost for others. For
example, the company will foot the bill
for the team dinner. That means the
company pays the whole check. I remember
being relieved when a vendor said,
"Don't worry, we'll foot the bill for
your hotel during the conference."
Always nice when someone else covers the
expense. And finally, the bottom line.
You hear this one a lot in business.
Literally, the bottom line is the last
line of a financial statement showing
net profit or loss. Idiomatically, it
means the final result or the most
important point. In business meetings,
someone might cut to the chase and say,
"The bottom line is we need to increase
market share by 5%." Or financially, the
bottom line for 2025 is a profit of $2
million. It's that ultimate summary.
What's the outcome? What's the core
point? You'll sound very businesssavvy
using bottom line. For example, the
bottom line is if we don't improve
quality, we'll lose customers. clear and
direct. And that's the bottom line for
our finance idiom segment. I think we've
broken even on time, don't you? Let's do
a quick recap. You learned how to talk
about profit and loss in the red, in the
black, describe money makers, cash cow,
and even complain about high costs, cost
an arm and a leg. And remember, next
time someone at work says, "Let's crunch
the numbers," you'll know they're not
planning a weird snack. They just mean
doing math. Coming up next, we'll move
from money to the day-to-day world of
work and productivity
idioms. Welcome back. Now that our
financial ducks are in a row, it's time
for productivity and work idioms. These
are the kinds of phrases you'll hear
when people talk about workloads,
deadlines, and getting things done, or
sometimes not getting them done. Let's
jump right in. First up, cut corners.
No, we're not literally cutting
anything. To cut corners means to do
something the easiest or cheapest way,
often at the expense of quality. Picture
taking a shortcut across a corner
instead of going around it. You save
time, but maybe you step on someone's
lawn. In business, if someone says,
"Don't cut corners on this project,"
they mean, "Don't skip necessary steps,
even if you're in a hurry." It's often
used in the negative, "We can't cut
corners when it comes to safety
testing." I learned early in my career,
cutting corners might save time now, but
cause bigger problems later. Next, hit
the ground running. This is what every
manager hopes a new hire will do. To hit
the ground running means to start a task
or new job with immediate energy and
progress without needing much ramp up.
Imagine parachuting in and as soon as
you land, you're already sprinting. For
example, our new marketing director hit
the ground running. She's already
launched two campaigns in her first
week. It's high praise for someone who's
proactive and quick to get started. Even
if you start a Monday super productive,
you can say you hit the ground running
that day. Next, burn the midnight oil.
If you've ever stayed up very late
working or studying, you've burned the
midnight oil. This comes from the old
days of oil lamps. If you're burning oil
at midnight, you're working late into
the night. We had to burn the midnight
oil to get that client proposal done on
time. It often implies hard work and
sacrificing sleep. I'll admit I burn the
midnight oil a bit too often when
editing this podcast. Not the best
habit. Don't forget to rest, too. Next
up, run out of steam. Think of an old
steam powered train slowing down when
it's low on coal. To run out of steam
means to lose momentum or energy. In a
project after the product launch, the
team ran out of steam. Everyone was
exhausted from the crunch. You can use
it for people or initiatives that start
strong then tire out. Watch for it in
your own schedule. If you feel like
you're running out of steam at 3 p.m.,
maybe it's time for a coffee break. Now,
on the back burner. When you move a pot
to the back burner, you're not focusing
on it right now. Similarly, if something
is on the back burner, it's postponed or
set aside in priority. Our plans to
expand the office are on the back burner
until next year. It's a polite way to
say not now. I use it all the time.
Great idea, but let's put it on the back
burner for now. Next idiom. Go the extra
mile. When you go the extra mile, you're
putting in more effort than is required,
often to achieve excellence. Our support
team goes the extra mile to help every
client. It's always positive. It implies
dedication and great service. Think of
an employee who doesn't just meet
expectations, they exceed them. They
definitely go the extra mile. Here's a
fun one. Bite off more than you can
chew. Ever take a huge bite of a burger
and realize, uh-oh, too much. In work
terms, if you bite off more than you can
chew, you've taken on more than you can
realistically handle. By volunteering
for three projects at once, I bit off
more than I could chew. It's a friendly
way to acknowledge overload. You could
even tell a colleague, "Looks like
you've bitten off a bit more than you
can chew. Need any help?" Just say it
supportively. Get the ball rolling. We
touched on this earlier, but let's
revisit it in context. To get the ball
rolling means to start something,
especially a big project. Okay team,
let's get the ball rolling on the new
campaign. If no one's starting a
meeting, someone might say, "Shall I get
the ball rolling?" It comes from games
or sports. Once the ball is rolling,
momentum delts. Speaking of starting,
sometimes getting started is the hardest
part, but once you do, momentum's on
your side. Next, get down to business. I
used this in the intro and it's worth
explaining. To get down to business
means to stop unrelated talk and start
focusing on the important task. A
meeting leader might say, "All right,
everyone. Let's get down to business."
You can even say it to yourself. I need
to get down to business and finish this
report. It's a great idiom to signal
time to focus. And last for this set,
all hands on deck. This one comes from
sailing ships. When there's important
work the captain calls all hands on
deck. In the office, it's all hands on
deck for the product launch. It means
everyone is required to pitch in. No
exceptions. It creates a sense of
camaraderie. We're all in it together.
Hopefully, not because the ship is
sinking, but because the project is so
important, every person's effort is
needed to succeed. Whe we've been
productive with these idioms about work.
We talked about not cutting corners,
sometimes burning the midnight oil, and
hopefully not biting off more than we
can chew. If you remember one thing,
when your boss says all hands on deck,
it's time to rally the team and give
that extra mile. Got it? Now, let's move
from individual productivity to how we
interact with others. Coming up next,
idioms about communication and teamwork.
Basically, how we work together. Stay
tuned. Welcome back to Business English
Breakroom. In this segment, we're
focusing on idioms that revolve around
communication, teamwork, and office
dynamics. These are phrases you'll often
hear in meetings, emails, or while
collaborating with colleagues. They help
describe how we share information and
how we work or sometimes don't work
together. Let's get on the same page by
starting with that very idiom on the
same page. If you and I are on the same
page, it means we have a shared
understanding or agreement about
something. Think of reading a book.
Being on the same page means we're
literally in the same spot in the story.
In business, let's ensure the whole team
is on the same page about the project
goals. I use this phrase a lot when
recapping a meeting. Just to make sure
we're on the same page, the deadline is
next Friday, and each of us will deliver
our parts by Wednesday. It's all about
alignment. You might ask a client, "Are
we on the same page with these
requirements to confirm you haven't
misunderstood each other?" It's an
excellent idiom for avoiding
miscommunication. Next, in the loop. To
be in the loop means to be included in
information sharing. Essentially, to be
kept informed of the latest updates.
Thanks for keeping me in the loop on the
budget changes. That's something you
might tell a colleague who updates you.
Conversely, I felt out of the loop on
that decision. Means you weren't
informed and felt a bit lost. In
teamwork, no one likes to be out of the
loop. So, if you're leading a project,
remember to CC people on emails or have
update meetings to keep everyone in the
loop that fosters trust and smooth
collaboration. Now, touch base. We had
this one in the list earlier. To touch
base means to briefly contact someone to
update or check in. It's often used when
scheduling informal updates. Let's touch
base later this week to see how the
sales numbers are looking. You can touch
base by email, call, or in person. It
implies a short, focused communication.
For instance, after a conference, you
might say, "I'll touch base with you
next week about that partnership idea."
It's a friendly, slightly casual way to
say you'll reconnect without a long
meeting. Next, bring to the table. When
someone asks, "What can you bring to the
table?" They're not talking about
furniture. They mean what skills, ideas,
or value can you contribute. For
example, she brings a lot to the table
with her experience in digital
marketing. In team settings, this idiom
often comes up when assembling a group.
We need each of you to bring something
unique to the table for this project.
Creativity, technical skill, industry
knowledge, etc. It highlights the idea
that everyone's contribution matters.
Here's a tougher one. throw someone
under the bus. We never want to
experience this one. As we discussed, it
means to betray or sacrifice a
colleague, usually to avoid blame or get
ahead. For example, I can't believe Jack
blamed the error on Maria in front of
the boss. He totally threw her under the
bus. It's a pretty harsh idiom, and
using it indicates serious disapproval
of that kind of behavior. And in a
healthy team, no one should be throwing
anyone under any buses. Instead, good
teams share responsibility. If something
goes wrong, you fix it together rather
than point fingers. If you hear, "I
won't throw you under the bus if
something goes wrong." It means I have
your back. Reassuring, right? Next, the
elephant in the room. This one paints a
vivid picture. Imagine an elephant
sitting in a meeting room that everyone
sees but pretends is not there. It
refers to a big obvious issue that no
one wants to talk about. For example,
let's address the elephant in the room,
our recent data breach, before we talk
about anything else. A great leadership
move is to acknowledge the elephant in
the room because it clears the air. It
can be awkward, but it builds trust to
not ignore the obvious. So if you sense
everyone is skirting around an issue,
gently call out the elephant
metaphorically. Next, by the book. To do
something by the book means to do it
strictly according to the rules or
official procedures. If a manager is
described as running things by the book,
they're very strict about following
policy. Example, our finance department
is by the book. Every expense must be
documented exactly, no exceptions. It
can be good for compliance, though
sometimes people use by the book to
imply someone is a bit inflexible.
Knowing when to be by the book and when
to be flexible can be a leadership
challenge. Now, get up to speed. When a
new team member joins, you might need to
get them up to speed. It means helping
them learn or catch up on what's
happening quickly. After I was out sick,
I had a meeting with my colleague to get
up to speed on the latest client
requests. You can ask, "Can you get me
up to speed on the project as a polite
way to request a briefing?" I love how
this idiom uses a speed metaphor, like
increasing your pace to match the team.
It's very commonly used when onboarding
people or when something has changed and
you need to inform others. The morning
briefing will get you up to speed on any
overnight developments. Next, beat
around the bush. This is what not to do
when clear communication is needed. To
beat around the bush means to avoid the
main topic and speak indirectly. People
do this when they're nervous about the
reaction or don't want to give bad news.
For example, stop beating around the
bush and tell me what the issue is. On
the flip side, if you find yourself
doing it, take a breath and get to the
point, which leads perfectly to our next
idiom, cut to the chase. The direct
counterpart to beating around the bush.
To cut to the chase means to skip
unnecessary details and get straight to
the main point. In a long email chain or
a meeting with too much fluff, someone
might say, "Let's cut to the chase. What
exactly do you need from us?" It
actually comes from old movies. Instead
of long dialogue, cut to the chase scene
for excitement. In business, time is
money. So, cutting to the chase politely
is appreciated when the situation calls
for it. Just be sure the context is
appropriate. It can sound abrupt if used
with superiors without tact. But among
peers, it's a great way to steer things
back on track. Excellent. We've
navigated some key communication idioms.
Now we're all on the same page about not
beating around the bush. See what I did
there? If you keep your teammates in the
loop and never throw them under the bus,
you'll create a positive workplace vibe.
Communication is key in business, and
these idioms will help you sound natural
when you collaborate. Up next, let's
sharpen our strategic minds. We'll
explore idioms related to strategy,
planning, and competitive moves in
business. These are the phrases that
come up when discussing big ideas or
game plans. Stay with us. We'll be
thinking outside the box in the next
segment.
If you enjoy talking strategy or you're
often in meetings about the next big
idea, this segment is for you. We're
covering strategy and planning idioms.
And interestingly, many of these come
from sports or games. They add great
flavor when you're discussing business
strategies, innovations, and problem
solving. Let's draw up the game plan.
First up, think outside the box. A
classic encouragement for creativity. To
think outside the box means to think in
an unconventional or innovative way
beyond the usual boundaries. The box
represents normal thinking patterns. You
might hear, "We're facing a tough
challenge. I need everyone to think
outside the box for solutions." If you
suggest something wild or new, that's
outside the box thinking. Sometimes it's
overused in corporate speak, but it
genuinely encourages creative thinking.
So, in brainstorming, don't be afraid to
say, "I'm thinking outside the box here,
but what if we?" Next, lowhanging fruit.
Picture a fruit tree. The lowhanging
fruit is the easiest to pick. In
business, it refers to easy wins or
simple tasks that yield good results.
For example, our marketing team's
lowhanging fruit is improving the
website SEO. It's straightforward and
will quickly boost traffic. Identifying
lowhanging fruit is a great strategy
early in projects. Tackle the simple
stuff first to build momentum. Just
remember, eventually you'll need to
climb higher for the harder fruits. Now,
ballpark figure. When you need an
estimate, not an exact number, ask for a
ballpark figure. It comes from baseball.
If it's in the ballpark, it's within a
reasonable range. Example, can you give
me a ballpark figure for next year's
travel budget? Maybe the answer is sure,
roughly $50,000. Not precise, but close
enough to plan with. This idiom helps
avoid false precision and shows you
understand the number is an
approximation. Just make sure your
ballpark figure is actually in the right
range. Here's one we all love. Win-win
situation. A win-win situation is an
outcome where everyone involved
benefits. It's the opposite of a zero-
sum game where one wins and another
loses. In negotiations, you strive for a
win-win. If we extend the contract and
add maintenance services, it's a
win-win. The client gets more support
and we secure their business for longer.
It's a great way to frame deals. People
love scenarios where nobody loses. Next,
a hard sell. If something is a hard
sell, it will be challenging to persuade
others about it. Maybe it's an expensive
product or a controversial idea. The new
policy to eliminate remote work is going
to be a hard sell to employees. It comes
from sales. Some products sell
themselves, others are a hard sell,
requiring lots of convincing. If I say
higher prices might be a hard sell in
this economy, I mean customers will need
a lot of convincing. Next up, play hard
ball. This means to act aggressively or
competitively to achieve your aim. In a
negotiation, if one side isn't yielding
and is using tough tactics, they're
playing hard ball. Example, our supplier
is playing hard ball. They refuse to
give any discount on the bulk order.
There's a time and place for hard ball,
but overusing it can damage
relationships. You might hear a warning.
They want to play hard ball, so be
prepared to walk away if needed. Now,
back to the drawing board. It means
starting over after a plan fails. For
example, our first marketing concept
didn't test well. It's back to the
drawing board for the creative team.
It's actually an optimistic idiom. It
focuses on future effort, not past
mistakes. Instead of saying we failed,
you can say it's back to the drawing
board. Next, game changer. A gamecher is
something that drastically changes the
current situation. For example, cloud
computing was a gamecher for small
businesses. Be careful not to label
minor tweaks as game changers. Save it
for truly big shifts. But when you do
find one, it's a powerful way to convey
excitement and impact. And finally for
this set, hit the nail on the head. To
hit the nail on the head is to exactly
identify the issue or make a point that
is precisely correct. For example, you
hit the nail on the head with that
comment about customer service. It's
strong positive reinforcement and
encourages clear thinking. And with
that, I think we've hit the nail on the
head for our strategy idiom section. You
now know how to talk about creative
thinking, outside the box, easy wins,
low-hanging fruit, tough negotiations,
playing hard ball, and revolutionary
ideas, game changers. These phrases will
help you sound savvy when you're
discussing big plans or analyzing why
something worked or didn't work. We're
coming close to the finish line. Our
last batch of idioms is about
leadership, success, and even a bit of
failure. the stuff of careers and
company culture. Some really useful ones
coming up like raising the bar and
no-brainers. Stick around for the grand
finale of our 50
idioms. Our final category is all about
leadership, success, and a few pitfalls
to avoid. These idioms often come up
when talking about career moves, company
policies, or evaluating outcomes.
They're a bit of a grabag, but all
relate to how we measure success or deal
with challenges in a business context.
Let's wrap up with a strong finish.
First up, raise the bar. When leaders
raise the bar, they set higher standards
or expectations. Think of a high jump
bar being lifted higher. You need to
jump better to clear it. Example, the
CEO has raised the bar on customer
service. Now, we're expected to respond
within 1 hour, not 24. It can be
motivating, though. Sometimes employees
might sigh if the bar keeps getting
raised. You might also use it
personally. Completing that
certification really raised the bar for
my own skills. Next, climb the corporate
ladder. This idiom paints a picture of
career progression as climbing a ladder
within an organization. She's ambitious
and wants to climb the corporate ladder
quickly. You'll hear it in career
advice. To climb the corporate ladder,
you often need to network and
continuously improve your skills.
Sometimes it has a negative connotation
if someone is too focused on
advancement, but generally it's a
neutral way to talk about career growth.
Next, golden handcuffs. Golden handcuffs
refer to financial incentives given to
employees to make it hard for them to
leave the company. Example, the VP wants
to quit, but the golden handcuffs of his
stock options are keeping him there.
Companies might proudly say, "We offer
golden handcuffs to highlight great
retention packages." Whereas employees
might say it rofully, "I'm in golden
handcuffs." Now throw in the towel from
boxing. It means to give up or admit
defeat. Example, after trying multiple
marketing strategies, we haven't
increased sales. I'm not ready to throw
in the towel yet, but we need to rethink
our approach. Leaders usually frame this
carefully, but it's a candid way to
express that sometimes ending something
is the realistic decision. Next, put all
your eggs in one basket. If you put all
your eggs in one basket, you risk
everything on a single opportunity or
idea. Relying solely on one big client
is like putting all our eggs in one
basket. It's a common way to caution
against overconentration, whether in
investments or business strategy. Next,
no-brainer. A no-brainer is a decision
so obvious that you don't need to think
much about it. Example, accepting the
fully funded research grant was a
no-brainer for us. Be mindful. If others
are unsure, calling it a no-brainer can
sound dismissive, so use it when
consensus is clear. Next, learning
curve. This refers to how difficult it
is to learn something. The time or
effort required. There was a steep
learning curve when I switched careers
to programming, but I'm comfortable now.
As a leader, you might reassure a new
employee. We know there's a learning
curve, but we'll provide training. Next,
corner the market. To corner the market
means to gain such a dominant position
that you control most of the supply or
sales. Example, they practically
cornered the market on search engines.
It's a powerful phrase to describe
competitive strategy. Next, red tape.
Red tape stands for excessive
bureaucracy and formal rules. We would
have finished the office renovation by
now, but there's so much red tape
getting city permits. Leaders often say,
"I'll handle the red tape." And teams
are usually very grateful for that. And
one more, the ball is in your court.
After you've taken action, the ball is
in your court means it's the other
party's turn to act. Example, I've given
you all the information. Now, the ball
is in your court. In negotiations, we've
submitted our best offer. So, the ball
is in their court to accept or reject.
And that idiom wraps up our list
perfectly because now the ball is in
your court, listeners, to start using
these idioms. Wow, what a journey
through leadership and success idioms.
You now know how to talk about raising
the bar, climbing the corporate ladder,
dealing with golden handcuffs, and
navigating red tape. among many others.
And with that, we've reached the grand
finale of our 50 business idioms you
need to know. We hope this episode gave
you practical phrases you can use
whether in meetings, emails, or casual
work chats. Remember, you can always
review the worksheet for a full list,
examples, and practice tasks. Thanks for
learning with us, and until next time,
keep raising the bar on your business
English. The ball is in your court.
Happy learning and see you in the next
Hello and welcome to the English Phrases
Hub podcast. I'm Emma and I'm Jake.
Great to have you with us. This is the
podcast where we make language learning
fun and engaging. In today's episode,
strengthen your listening skills with
hilarious English conversations. We're
going to help English learners improve
their listening comprehension and have a
good laugh at the same time. Because
when you're laughing and smiling, you're
more relaxed and that actually helps you
learn better. Exactly. Studies even show
that humor can diffuse tension and make
it easier to remember new material. So
true. And in this episode, we'll
introduce you to a really helpful
listening strategy called chunking.
We'll explain what chunking is in simple
terms and show you how to use it to
better understand spoken English. And of
course, we've prepared some fun
practice, a series of hilarious but easy
to follow English dialogues based on
real life situations, like ordering food
at a restaurant, making small talk at a
party, and handling a funny
misunderstanding. Here's how it'll work.
First, we'll perform each skit at normal
speed so you get the real experience.
Then, we'll repeat it slowly and break
it into chunks. We'll explain what each
part means and how you can use it. By
the end of this episode, you'll not only
have had some laughs, you'll also have
picked up new phrases and improved your
ability to catch fast English in real
life. So, wherever you are, on the bus,
at home, or out for a walk, get
comfortable and let's dive in. And don't
worry if you don't catch everything the
first time. That's what we're here for.
We'll guide you through each
conversation and share tips on how you
can keep practicing with these dialogues
even after the episode. All right, ready
to strengthen your listening skills with
some laughs? Let's get
started. Before we jump into our comedy
conversations, let's talk about a key
listening strategy, chunking. You might
be wondering, what is chunking? Well,
simply put, chunking means breaking
language into small, meaningful groups
of words or chunks instead of listening
for one word at a time. Exactly. When
native speakers talk, they don't usually
say each word separately. They group
words all together like this. Yeah. Did
you catch that? It's nearly impossible
to understand when the words are all
jumbled together with no breaks, right?
Instead, good listeners focus on phrases
or word groups. Think of chunking like
taking big bites of information that are
easier to chew rather than trying to
swallow everything whole. For example,
if someone says, "I'm going to head out
now, but let's catch up again soon." You
can chunk it into, "I'm going to head
out now and let's catch up again soon."
Each of those chunks is a meaningful
piece of the sentence. And by focusing
on chunks, you digest the meaning more
easily. And there's research behind
this, too. Studies show that our brains
actually prefer it this way. We remember
phrases much better than isolated words.
Exactly. It's much easier to recall a
familiar phrase like how you doing as
one unit instead of trying to piece it
together word by word. That's right.
Chunking lightens the load on your
brain. By listening for groups of words
that naturally go together, you reduce
the effort needed to process what you
hear. And this helps you understand
faster speech more easily because you're
processing several words at once instead
of just one by one. And here's a tip.
Even if you don't know every single
word, that's okay. Advanced listeners do
this all the time. They grab the chunks
of meaning and don't get stuck on the
little words. So, how can you practice
chunking? Well, a great way is to listen
to dialogues like the ones we'll do
today and try to notice natural breaks
or pauses. For instance, in the
sentence, "Welcome to Burger Barn. May I
take your order?" You'll often hear a
tiny pause after welcome to Burger Barn
before may I take your order. Those are
two chunks. And don't worry, we'll help
you spot these in our skits. The more
you practice listening this way, the
more you'll train your ear to pick up
phrases, not just individual words. And
guess what? This will also help your
speaking. When you learn in chunks,
you'll start speaking in chunks, which
is how native speakers talk. It makes
you sound way more fluent. But for
today, our focus is listening. So keep
this idea of chunking in mind as we move
into our conversations. Listen for the
phrases that belong together. And even
if you miss a word, try to catch the
general meaning from the chunk. All
right, with that strategy in your
toolkit, let's put it into practice. Get
ready for our first hilarious English
conversation. As you listen, try to
relax and enjoy the story. And remember,
don't panic if you miss something. After
each dialogue, we'll slow it down, chunk
it, and explain everything. Okay, on to
comedy dialogue one.
Hi there. Welcome to Burger Barn. How
can I help you today? Uh, hello. I I
would like a burger, please. Sure. Which
burger would you like? We have a
cheeseburger, a chicken burger, and a
veggie burger. Burger. Burger. I think
I'll have the cheeseburger. Oh, and a
coffee, please. One cheeseburger and one
coffee. Great. Would you like anything
else? H um actually I also want fries.
Uh small fries. No problem. One small
fries for here or to go. Sorry. For here
or to go? Do you want to eat here or
take the food with you? Oh, I'll take it
to go. I need to go back to work. Got
it. So that's one cheeseburger, one
small fries, and one coffee to go. Your
total comes to
$8.50. Handing over cash, here you are.
$10. Thanks. And $1.50 is your change.
Thank you very much. Your order will be
ready in a minute. So, how's your day
going? It's going well, but actually,
I'm a little hungry. That's why I'm
here. I figured. Lunchtime rush, huh?
Yes. I was so busy this morning, I
forgot to eat breakfast. By lunchtime,
my stomach was growling like a bear. Oh,
wow. You must be starving. Well, we'll
get your food ready quick. Thanks. Here
you go. One cheeseburger, fries, and
coffee. Be careful. The coffee is really
hot. Thank you. Oh, um, excuse me. I
actually wanted my coffee iced, not hot.
Oh, my bad. I must have misheard. No
worries. I'll fix that. Calls to
kitchen. One iced coffee for Tom. Thank
you so much and sorry for the trouble.
No problem at all. We want to get it
right. It'll just be a moment. You know,
I'm actually glad you gave me hot coffee
first. Really? Why? I learned a new
phrase. My bad. I've never heard that
before. Now I know I can say my bad to
mean my mistake. That's great. You got a
coffee and a lesson for free. Here's
your iced coffee. Perfect. Have a nice
day. You too. Thanks for coming to
Burger Barn.
Poor Tom. At least he got his coffee in
the end. Did you catch why that
misunderstanding happened? Explaining
Tom ordered a coffee, but he didn't say
hot or iced. So Alice assumed it was a
hot coffee, which is the default, right?
Tom actually wanted an iced coffee. When
he pointed it out, Alice said, "My bad."
which is a very casual way to say,
"Oops, that's my mistake." Good for Tom.
He learned a new slangy heart. There was
a lot of useful everyday language in
that dialogue. Awesome. Now, let's break
it down and talk about some of those
chunks and phrases. Welcome to Burger
Barn. How can I help you today? Alice
said this in one friendly breath. We can
chunk it as welcome to Burger Barn and
how can I help you today? How can I help
you? Is a common polite phrase you'll
hear in stores or restaurants. It
basically means, "What would you like?"
If that was too fast at first, listening
to it in two pieces makes it easier. Tom
said, "I would like a burger, please." A
polite way to order. I would like is a
great chunk to remember for requests.
Tom could also say, "I'll have a burger,
please." Same meaning. And notice he
used please. Always good for politeness.
We can chunk that as I would like a
burger please. Altogether it's a
complete thought. Then Alice asked would
you like anything else? She didn't say
it word by word slowly. It sounded like
one quick phrase. Would you like
anything else? If you listen for the
chunk anything else, you'll recognize
she's asking if Tom wants something
more. And this phrase would you like
anything else is extremely common when
you're ordering food. It's a good one to
remember as a whole chunk. Next, for
here or to go. This is a fixed
expression at cafes and restaurants. It
probably sounded fast. For here or to
go, it means are you eating here or
taking it out. If you catch to go,
you'll know they're asking about
takeout. Tom was a little confused at
first, but once Alice explained eat here
or take it with you, he understood and
replied to go. So remember for here or
to go as one piece, you will hear it
often when you order food. Now numbers
and money. Alice said your total comes
to
$8.50. That whole sentence is a chunk
meaning your total is $8.50.
Sometimes cashiers just say $8.50,
please. Tom handed her a $10 bill and
she said $1.50 is your change. helpful.
Listening for key words like total and
change can help you understand that
you're dealing with the price and the
money returned. Friendly. Now, casual
small talk. While waiting, Alice asked,
"How's your day going?" A chunk you can
use to start a friendly conversation.
It's basically, "How are you?" in
context. Smiling, Tom said he was busy
and forgot to eat breakfast and joked,
"My stomach was growling like a bear."
That's such a funny expression. Growling
is the rumbling sound your stomach makes
when you're very hungry. And saying like
a bear exaggerates it. Native speakers
love using these fun images. Teaching
tone. If you hear like a, it's often
part of a simile, a chunk describing how
something is happening. Like hungry like
a wolf. Now about the misunderstanding
and my bad. At the end, Tom expected an
iced coffee but got a hot coffee.
Friendly. When he pointed it out, Alice
said, "Oh, my bad." A slang chunk to
remember. My bad means my mistake. It's
very casual and friendly. And we chunk
it as one phrase. We wouldn't separate
my and bad because together they have
that meaning. Smiling. Tom was happy
because he learned that new phrase.
Encouraging. Those were some great
phrases. Can you imagine walking into a
cafe now? You could say, "I'd like a
cheeseburger and a coffee to go,
please." And you'd be golden. And if you
make a small mistake, now you know you
can laugh and say, "Oops, my bad."
Teaching tone. And beyond the phrases,
notice how chunking really helped
explaining. If you listen again, try to
hear how Alice and Tom naturally pause
or group words. They don't say, "I would
like a burger." with a pause on every
word. Instead, Tom said, "I would like a
burger, please." Grouping words into a
meaningful unit. Explaining. By
practicing with this dialogue, you can
train yourself to catch those units.
Reminding feel free to rewind and listen
to the conversation again at normal
speed or slow to test your listening.
Great. Now that we've warmed up at the
restaurant, let's move to our next funny
scenario. Ready for some awkward small
talk at a party? Here comes comedy
dialogue, too. Hey there. I don't think
we've met before. I'm Mark. Hi, Mark.
Nice to meet you. I'm Bella. Nice to
meet you, too, Bella. How are you
enjoying the party? It's fun, though.
The music is a bit loud. I have to yell
so you can hear me. True. The DJ is
enthusiastic tonight. So, Bella, what do
you do? Oh, I'm grabbing a drink right
now. Do you want one? I meant what do
you do for a living? Your job? Oh, my
job. I work at a bank. I'm a teller. I
help customers at the bank. That's
great. Which bank do you work at? I work
at First National downtown. Oh, I have
an account there. I might have seen you.
Anyway, what do you do for fun when
you're not working? Any hobbies? Hm. I
like painting. And actually, I love
dancing. Dancing? No kidding. At this
party, you're in the right place. I
know, right? I was so excited when I
heard there'd be music. I can be a real
party animal. Me, too. By the way, are
you from the city originally? Your
accent sounds a little different. It's
cool. Oh, I'm originally from Brazil. I
moved here 2 years ago for work. Wow,
your English is really good. Thank you.
I've been practicing. I still get
nervous talking, especially at parties.
You're doing awesome. And hey, talking
over loud music is hard for everyone. I
think we all only catch half the
conversation in this noise. So true.
Sometimes I just nod and smile and hope
it's the right response. We've all been
there. By the way, what do you do? I'm a
software developer. I write code for a
tech company. Oh, nice. software like
shirts and pants. Software, not
software. I mean I make computer
programs, apps, that kind of thing. Oh,
sorry. Software. Got it. Sorry, the
music is really loud. No worries. That
was a good one. Software developer. I
should start a clothing line. Yes, I'd
buy your soft sweaters. You know, that
misunderstanding was actually pretty
funny. It was. I'm going to remember the
difference between software and software
now for sure. Honestly, those two sound
almost the same in English, especially
here with all this noise. You handled
that like a champ. Thanks. Talking with
you is a lot of fun. Likewise. Hey,
after this song, want to go get some
fresh air? It's a bit loud in here.
Sure, that sounds good.
That was a fun conversation. Poor Bella
misheard software as software. No wonder
she was confused, thinking Mark works
with shirts and pants. This shows how
tricky English can be with similar
sounding words, especially with loud
background noise. Now, let's discuss
some parts of this dialogue. Initial
small talk. Mark starts with, "I don't
think we've met before. I'm Mark." This
is a common chunk to introduce yourself
at a social event. Bella responded,
"Nice to meet you. I'm Bella." Those are
useful phrases for meeting new people.
Notice the chunk nice to meet you. It's
a fixed polite expression. They also
used how are you enjoying the party?
Which is similar to how do you like the
party? An easy conversation starter.
Bella joked about having to yell because
of loud music. A light-hearted comment
to break the ice. What do you do? Mark
asked Bella, "What do you do?" And Bella
misunderstood, thinking he meant right
now. In English, what do you do usually
means, what do you do for a living?
What's your job? It's a very common
chunk in small talk. Bella realized and
said she works as a bank teller. So
remember when someone asks what do you
do at a party, they probably mean your
job, not literally what you're doing in
that moment. For a living. Mark even
added for a living to clarify. That's a
chunk meaning to earn money or as a
career. For example, I draw cartoons for
a living. Bella explained her job and
even the term teller. the person at a
bank who handles transactions and even
if you didn't know teller the context I
help customers at the bank gives you a
clue hobbies Mark then steered the
conversation to free time what do you do
for fun any hobbies another typical
small talk move Bella said she likes
painting and dancing and when she said I
can be a real party animal that's a fun
idiom party animal is a chunk meaning
someone who loves parties and
socializing And if you hear someone is a
party animal, it doesn't mean they're an
actual animal. It's figurative. Catching
that chunk as one idea is key. Talking
about origins, Mark asked if Bella is
from the city because he noticed an
accent. Asking, "Are you from
originally?" is a polite way to ask
where someone grew up or was born. Bella
said she's from Brazil and has been here
for 2 years. Mark complimented her
English. Always nice. Bella admitted she
gets nervous talking, especially at
parties, which many learners can relate
to. Mark reassured her that even native
speakers struggle to hear in loud
environments. He joked, "We only catch
half the conversation in this noise."
Catch here means hear or understand. So,
I only caught half of that is a chunk
meaning I only understood half of what
you said. Now, the misunderstanding
software versus software.
Mark said, "I'm a software developer. I
write code." But Bella heard software.
Because they sound almost the same when
spoken quickly, especially with
background noise, Bella thought of soft
clothing. Once Mark laughed and
clarified software, not software, they
both had a good laugh. This is a great
example of how chunking and context
help. If you heard software as a chunk,
you'd know it's techreated. But if you
broke it wrongly in your mind, you might
think softwear. Mark even turned it into
a joke. I should start a clothing line
of soft sweaters, which helped Bella
feel less embarrassed. Handling
misunderstandings. Notice how Bella
apologized and laughed it off. Oh,
sorry. Got it. The music is loud. And
Mark said, "No worries." A very casual
way to say, "No problem. It's okay."
Also, Mark said, "We've all been there."
meaning we all have had that experience.
He was reassuring her that
misunderstandings happen to everyone.
And end of conversation, Mark and Bella
continued smoothly after the hiccup,
which is realistic. They even decided to
step outside for quiet. Want to get some
fresh air? A nice chunk or idiom meaning
go outside for a break. This dialogue is
a perfect example of how chunking works
in real life. If you only caught
software and got confused, that's okay.
It was a mishering. But if you were
listening in context, you'd know Mark
was talking about his job. So software
developer makes sense as a chunk,
whereas software doesn't fit that
context. When you listen, try to use
context to confirm the chunks you think
you hear. And remember, if you do
misunderstand someone, it's totally fine
to say, "Sorry, I didn't catch that."
Or, "Did you mean this?" Often people
will laugh and clarify just like Mark
did. And Bella did a great job keeping
the conversation going. She even made a
joke back about soft sweaters. Using
humor can save an awkward moment and
actually create a bonding experience. So
as English learners, don't be afraid of
small misunderstandings. They can turn
into learning moments. And now Bella and
you listeners will never forget the
difference between software and
software. Absolutely. Key phrases to
remember from this skit. What do you do
for a living? party animal. I only
caught half of that. No worries. And get
some fresh air. These are all common
chunks in everyday English
conversations. Listen for them in real
life or other media. You'll start
noticing them a lot. Great. Now, on to
our final funny conversation. This one
involves a classic idiomatic
misunderstanding. One friend says
something idiomatic and the other takes
it way too literally. Let's hear comedy
dialogue three.
I'm so tired
today. Work was nonstop.
Really? You should relax now. We're off
work. I know. I just need to hit the
books tonight for my online course,
though. I have an exam tomorrow. Wait,
hit the books? Why would you hit books?
What did the books do to you? looks
genuinely concerned. Oh, hit the books
just means I need to study. I'm not
going to punch my textbooks. I promise.
Ah, okay. That phrase always confuses
me. In my head, I see someone literally
slapping a book around. I love that
image. English has so many silly idioms
like that. Seriously, last week someone
at work told me to break a leg before my
presentation. I was so startled. Why
would they say that? Break a leg means
good luck. They say it in the theater
world and it became a common idiom for
wishing someone luck, oddly enough. Good
thing I knew that one or I'd have been
very confused why my coworker wanted me
injured. Right. Anyway, I'm a bit
stressed about this exam. There's so
much material to review. Is it a big
exam? Yeah, pretty important. I really
want to do well. You've been studying
hard. You're going to ace it, I'm sure.
Thanks for the vote of confidence. No
problem. Actually, since you have to
study tonight, maybe we shouldn't go out
for dinner. I don't want to twist your
arm. Twist my arm. I'm not forcing you
to do anything.
Gotcha. I was using an idiom on purpose
to see if you'd take it literally like I
did. Twist your arm means convince you
or pressure you to do something. Oh wow,
you flipped the script on me. Well done.
I've been practicing my idioms so I can
speak more naturally. But yeah, I won't
twist your arm about dinner. We can
order takeout so you can study. Sounds
like a plan. Maybe some pizza. Pizza it
is. Fuel for your brain. Then you hit
the books, ace the exam, and next time
we hang out, the drinks are on me to
celebrate your success. That sounds
awesome. And hey, you used the drinks
are on me correctly. Look at you, idiom.
Thank you. Thank you. I try. All right,
let's get that pizza and then I'll dive
into study mode. Thanks for
understanding. Of course. Good luck and
break a leg on your exam tomorrow in the
idiomatic way. Thanks. I'll do my
best. That dialogue had me cracking up.
Larry is so literal, imagining someone
actually hitting books with their fist.
But by the end, he showed he's learning
his idioms, too. Let's slow it down and
unpack some of those idioms and
expressions because wow, there were a
lot in there. Let's break down the
goodies in this conversation. Hit the
books. Jen said she needs to hit the
books. As we saw, Larry took it
literally, but it's an idiom meaning to
study intensely. It's like saying I have
to attack my studies. We treat hit the
books as a single chunk. Those words
together mean study. Nothing to do with
actual hitting. Idioms often work like
that. The whole phrase has a meaning you
can't guess from the individual words.
Larry mentioned someone told him break a
leg. This idiom means good luck.
Commonly used for performances or big
events. If you didn't know this chunk,
it could sound shocking as Larry felt at
first, but it's a very well-known idiom
in English. When you recognize it as a
chunk, you understand they're wishing
you well, not hoping you literally get
hurt. Ace it. Larry told Jen you're
going to ace it. Meaning he's sure
she'll do very well on the exam. Ace as
a verb is a chunk meaning to do
something perfectly or very
successfully. For example, ace a test or
ace an interview. It's informal and
encouraging. I don't want to twist your
arm. Here, Larry used an idiom
intentionally. To twist someone's arm
means to pressure or strongly persuade
someone to do something they might not
want to do. He said it to imply, "I
won't pressure you." Jen, hearing it
literally, got confused for a second.
I'm not forcing you. Then Larry revealed
he was joking. This shows how confusing
idioms can be if you haven't heard them
before. But once you learn the chunk,
twist your arm, you'll know no actual
arm twisting is happening. The drinks
are on me. At the end, Larry said, "Next
time the drinks are on me." On me in
this context is a chunk meaning I will
pay for it. So drinks are on me means I
will pay for the drinks. It's a generous
offer. And don't worry, nothing is
literally on top of Larry. Larry's idiom
practice. The fun part is Larry using
idioms correctly by the end. He says
break a leg on your exam in the
idiomatic way to make sure Jen knows he
means good luck. This shows that even if
you start out like literal Larry, over
time you can learn these weird
expressions. The key is hearing them in
context, as chunks, and remembering the
meaning as a whole. Other chunks. There
were a few other nice phrases. Jen said
work was non-stop, meaning very busy, no
breaks. Larry said, "We're off work,"
meaning the workday is done. An everyday
phrase. Jen thanked Larry for the vote
of confidence, which is a chunk, meaning
thanks for believing in me. These are
the kinds of natural pieces of English
you pick up bit by bit. This dialogue
was packed with idioms and we saw how
context and chunking help them. If you
can hit the books in a sentence about
studying or twist your arm in a context
about convincing someone, you can figure
out the meaning or at least realize it's
not literal. A good tip is when you hear
a phrase that seems odd or makes you
imagine something silly like breaking
legs or twisting arms, ask yourself,
could this be an idiom or expression? It
often is. Over time, you'll get familiar
with common ones. And Larry's strategy
of practicing idioms in conversation is
fantastic. Using new phrases in a real
conversation, even jokingly, helps you
remember them. Just like Larry will
never forget hit the books, you can bet
you'll remember these idioms now that
you've heard this skit. Repetition in a
fun context really makes it stick.
Absolutely. The more you encounter a
chunk or phrase, the more natural it
will become. That's why we made these
dialogues funny and memorable. So the
language in them sticks in your mind
along with the laughter. This ties back
to what we said at the start. If you
enjoy the process, like laughing at a
joke or story, you're likely to remember
the English that you heard. Let's take a
moment to reflect on what we just did
and talk about how you can use these
dialogues and others like them to keep
improving your listening and
comprehension. First, notice how we
repeated each dialogue slowly and then
discussed it. This kind of active
listening practice is something you can
do on your own, too. For example, when
you listen to an English podcast or
watch a TV show, try pausing and
summarizing to yourself what you heard
in chunks. If there's a transcript
available, you can listen once, then
read and listen again to catch anything
you missed. Over time, you'll find you
rely less on the transcript and
understand more just by ear. Use these
dialogues as practice material. You can
replay the episode and shadow the
conversations. Shadowing means listening
to a line and then repeating it
yourself, trying to mimic the
pronunciation and intonation. It's a
great way to improve listening and
speaking together. For instance, play
Alice's line, "Would you like anything
else?" Then pause and say it yourself.
This helps reinforce the chunk as a unit
of speech in your brain. Plus, it
improves your pronunciation and rhythm
in English. Another tip, try to
visualize the scenes as you listen. Our
brains love stories. If you imagine Tom
at the burger barn counter or Bella
misunderstanding software, it creates a
mental movie. This makes the language
more memorable. You're not just hearing
words, you're experiencing a situation,
and that can greatly improve retention
of new phrases and makes practice more
fun. Also, don't be afraid to listen
multiple times. Even native speakers
relisten to things to catch details.
Each time you listen, focus on something
different. First time for general
understanding and humor. Second time for
new words or phrases. third time to
notice how things were said. Tone,
chunking, intonation. Each pass you'll
discover something new. And each time
you're training your ear. One more
strategy, make use of context clues like
we discussed. If you hear a word you
don't know, pay attention to the words
around it and the situation in the party
dialogue. Bella didn't know software at
first, but talking about jobs and
hearing developer and tech company
around it could hint it's something with
computers. Context often gives away the
meaning or at least helps you not derail
the whole conversation because of one
unknown word. Finally, keep things
enjoyable and relevant. Listen to
content that makes you laugh or
interests you, like these funny
dialogues or any topic you love. When
you're engaged, you naturally want to
understand more and you'll put in the
effort without it feeling like a chore.
As we saw, humor can be a great tool for
learning. It keeps you relaxed and
attentive. You can even try making your
own little dialogues or jokes in
English, as silly as you like. It's a
fun way to practice. The big takeaway,
active listening practice, chunking,
shadowing, repeating, and analyzing
phrases will improve your comprehension
over time. And using fun content keeps
you motivated. With each practice
session, you'll find you catch a little
more of fast English and rely less on
translation. Little by little, those
gibberish streams of English start
turning into comprehensible phrases in
your mind. That's progress. We hope you
enjoyed this episode as much as we did.
Today, we tackled the challenge of
listening comprehension with a mix of
education and humor. We introduced
chunking as a strategy to make sense of
rapid English. And we saw it in action
through our three comedy sketches. From
ordering a cheeseburger to dancing at a
party to decoding weird idioms, we
covered a lot of ground. Remember, the
key is to practice a little every day.
Release to these dialogues. Try some of
the techniques we discussed, and don't
be afraid to rewind and repeat. The more
you expose yourself to real
conversational English in manageable
chunks, the better you'll get. And
importantly, keep it fun. If you can
smile or laugh while learning, you'll
look forward to your practice sessions.
Before we go, here's a little
encouragement. You got this. Every
listener out there, no matter what your
level is right now, can improve with
time and practice. Even if native
speakers still sometimes sound like
they're speaking at a 100 miles an hour,
you are training your ears to catch up.
Think of listening practice like going
to the gym. Every session makes your
listening muscles a bit stronger. And
we're happy you chose to out with us

Welcome everyone to English Phrases Hub.
I'm uh really happy you're joining us
today. Hello. Today we're looking
closely at some source material that
tackles something many English learners
find well a bit challenging. Uh-huh. But
also really rewarding, right? Exactly.
How to start a conversation with someone
new. It's a topic that resonates with so
many people, isn't it? I mean, starting
a
conversation, it can feel surprisingly
tricky. It really can. And for anyone
navigating English as an additional
language, well, it can feel especially
um intimidating sometimes. Absolutely.
So many people feel shy or, you know,
awkward or they worry about making
mistakes. But here's where it gets
really interesting based on the research
in your sources. That feeling of
nervousness, it's totally normal. It's
incredibly common even for native
speakers, right? One piece of research
you included highlights that uh two in
three Americans think small talk is
awkward. Wow. Two and three. Yeah. And
70%, get this, 70% would rather just sit
in silence. That statistic is
fascinating, isn't it? It really shows
you are definitely not alone if you feel
a bit nervous. Not at all. And what's
also clear from the material is that
pushing past that initial hesitation,
well, it has huge upsides. Like what?
You know, making new friends, building
professional connections, or sometimes
just having a pleasant interaction. It
all counts. And another compelling
finding from the research you provided
People often report being happier after
chatting with a stranger than if they'd
stayed quiet. Exactly. It suggests we
sort of overestimate how badly it might
go. You know, we do. The fear is often
worse than the reality. And the good
news, as highlighted in the materials,
is that starting conversations is a
skill. Ah, okay. So, you can get better
at it. Absolutely. It improves with
practice. Okay. So, before we really get
into how-to, let's quickly define our
terms because they're used throughout
your sources. Small talk. What is that
exactly? Right. So, small talk just
refers to that light, casual
conversation, usually about simple uh
non-controversial topics. Nothing too
heavy. Got it. And an icebreaker. An
icebreaker is more specific. It's like a
phrase or maybe even an action that's
really designed to ease that initial
tension. Okay. Or just break the silence
when people first meet. Hence, break the
ice. Right. Makes sense. Think of small
talk as a bridge then. That's how one
source put it. A bridge. I like that.
Yeah. It's not usually the main
destination maybe, but it gets you
across that initial awkward gap to
potentially more meaningful
conversations. Exactly. And one source
noted that 91% of Americans believe
small talk can actually lead to real
connection. So, it's worth doing. So,
what's important not to do based on
these insights? Maybe putting too much
pressure on it. Yes, exactly. Don't put
too much pressure on the outcome of that
first interaction. The goal of an opener
really is just to open the door, right?
A short, friendly chat is a success in
itself. It doesn't have to be
earthshattering. And if you're someone
who feels, you know, shy or maybe more
introverted, the advice seems consistent
across the board. Mhm. Start small. Mhm.
Start small. Maybe just a smile, a nod
first and then add a simple greeting
when you feel a bit more ready. That's
great advice. And another really
practical tip found in your sources for
managing that initial anxiety is um
projecting positivity with your body
language. How so? Well, you know, a
smile, making some relaxed eye contact,
keeping your arms uncrossed. These
outward signals can surprisingly help
you feel calmer. Huh, interesting. And
they also make you appear more
approachable to the other person. It's a
win-win. So, kind of fake it till you
make it, but it actually helps. Sort of.
Yeah. and assume the interaction will go
reasonably well. Just try to have that
positive expectation. And remember, the
other person might also be feeling a bit
nervous. Exactly. They might even be
relieved that you took the initiative.
Okay. So, based on all this material,
our mission in this deep dive is really
to equip you with practical insights,
some key phrases. Yeah. To feel more
confident just saying hello. We'll go
through, like you said, a toolkit of
phrases, look at different scenarios,
social, work, travel, online, and even
do some practice together. All drawn
from the sources you've given us. Looks
like a plan. We'll keep the pace clear,
conversational, perfect for intermediate
to advanced English learners who are
ready to, you know, put this knowledge
into practice, ready to jump into that
toolkit. Absolutely. Let's gather those
tools. All right. Based on the
materials, here's your essential
conversation starter toolkit. Tool
number one.
It's the most basic but um fundamental.
A simple greeting and introduction.
Exactly. Can't go wrong with this. A
friendly hello or hi, maybe a smile and
just stating your name, I'm your name.
Right. Often just saying hi, I'm Jake is
enough. The other person will typically
respond with their name and well the
conversation has begun. Simple as that.
Yeah. Hello, my name's Emma. Depending
on the specific context, you might add
something like, "Uh, I don't think we've
met before." Right? Or if you're
entering a shared space, maybe like
joining a table. Mind if I join you?
Good one. Okay. Tool number two, found
across multiple sources. Ask a simple
question. Yes, this works because well,
people generally enjoy sharing about
themselves or giving an opinion. Okay.
We can break these down into say
situational questions and light personal
questions. Situational. So tied to where
you are. Exactly. Tied directly to the
environment you both share. So if you're
waiting for a bus, one article suggests
asking, "Has the bus been running late
today?" Okay. At a party, maybe. Have
you tried the cake? It's really good. At
a conference, what did you think of the
last speaker? They're easy because the
topic is literally right there in front
of you. And of course, the weather that
came up a lot. Ah, yes. The classic.
It's mentioned everywhere because it's
universally relatable, isn't it?
Totally. Beautiful day, isn't it? Or,
can you believe all this rain we're
having? It just creates an instant
shared experience you can comment on.
Okay. And for light personal questions,
what's safe territory there? Keep it
appropriate for a first chat. Things
like, where are you from? That's usually
fine. What do you do for a living,
meaning your job, or what are you
studying? If you're maybe in a
university setting, right? Or at a
party, like we said, how do you know the
host? That's always a good one. But the
key is keeping it light, right? No deep
secrets. Definitely. Remember the advice
is keep these light. Topics like work,
studies, general background, where
someone's from, that's all good.
Anything too sensitive, you know,
detailed finances, personal problems,
not for initial small talk. Got it. Tool
number three, find and mention common
ground. Yes. If you already know you
share something, use it. It's like a
shortcut. How so? Well, say you see
their band t-shirt. Hey, I love that
band. Great choice. Oh, okay. Or if
you're both in the same class, we're in
the same marketing workshop, right? How
are you finding it? So, it gives you an
immediate easy topic. Exactly. And you
can also discover common ground by
asking those initial questions we talked
about, like, what brings you here? Or,
how do you know people at this event?
Their answers might reveal something you
have in common. Okay, makes sense. Tool
number four. This one was widely
recommended in your sources. Give a
compliment. Yes, a genuine appropriate
compliment. It's a fantastic icebreaker.
Why does it work so well? Well, it
simply makes people feel good, doesn't
it? And it shows you're observant and
positive. Like, what kind of compliment?
Could be anything appropriate. I love
your shoes. Those are really cool. Or in
a professional setting, maybe your
presentation was excellent, really
clear. You could even compliment
something less direct, like an
interesting name, or comment on
something you overheard that relates to
you, like, "Excuse me, I heard you say
you're from Toronto. I've always wanted
to visit there." As long as it's
sincere, it's usually a positive start,
right? Sincerity is key. One tip we saw,
I think, from Chris Americos suggested
combining a compliment with an
introduction. Oh, yeah. How would that
work? Like, your English is great. Hi,
I'm Emma. Oh, that's clever. I like
that. Or, that's a great jacket. Where
did you get it? I'm Jake, by the way.
See, it flows really naturally. It does.
Let's also revisit the idea of
open-ended questions. Your sources
really stress how important these are
for keeping a conversation going.
Absolutely. Because a closed question,
well, it can often be answered with just
yes or no. Right. Like, are you enjoying
the event? Yes. End of story
potentially. Yeah. Whereas an open-ended
question invites a longer response like,
"What do you think of the event so far?"
Or, "What do you do for fun?" So,
open-ended questions give the other
person more opportunity to share, which
stops the chat from just fizzling out.
Exactly. Now, closed questions can work,
but they often need a follow-up question
immediately after to keep things moving.
Ah, okay. So, if they say, "Yes, I'm
enjoying it." You could quickly follow
up with something open, like, "Oh, good.
What's been your favorite part so far?"
Precisely. That follow-up shows you're
listening and you're interested. Using
words like how, why, or phrases like
tell me more about are great for this.
And that leads perfectly to another
crucial piece of advice from the
sources. Conversation is a two-way
street. Like a game of pingpong, one
source said. Yeah, I like that analogy.
Don't just fire questions one after
another, right? You need to respond to
their answers. Maybe share a little bit
about yourself to use those little
phrases that show you're engaged. Like,
me, too. Oh, really? That's interesting.
Active listening, basically. Active
listening. Exactly. Okay. One final
piece of advice for openers. This seems
especially relevant online, but maybe
useful in person, too.
Contextualize your opening. What do you
mean by contextualize? Well, just
saying, "Hi," out of the blue can be a
bit confusing, right? Especially online,
you need to give a reason. Ah, okay. So,
online, you might say, "Hi, I saw your
post in the travel forum about Spain.
I'm actually planning a trip there,
too." Exactly. Gives them the why. And
in person, it might be the introduction
itself that provides context, like, "I
don't think we've met. I'm Emma. I work
in the accounting department." or
mentioning something relevant you
overheard. Like we said before, I
couldn't help but overhear you talking
about photography. I love photography.
Got it. So, to recap the toolkit from
the materials, simple greetings and
introductions, asking situational or
light personal questions, finding common
ground, giving genuine compliments,
using open-ended questions, and
following up, and always remembering
friendly body language. That seems key.
Those are definitely the core
strategies. Now, let's see how we can
apply them in specific settings.
Starting with, say, social situations.
Okay, let's imagine you're at a party,
maybe a social gathering, and you might
only know the host. How do you actually
start talking to other people there,
right? This can feel a bit daunting. One
of the articles suggests first just scan
the room. Look for someone who seems
approachable. What does approachable
look like? Maybe someone standing alone,
not already deep in a discussion.
Perhaps they have open body language,
making eye contact. Then the advice is
pretty simple. Just walk up and say
hello. A straightforward opener for this
setting could be, "Hi, I'm Nate. I don't
think we've met yet." Yeah. Friendly,
direct, works well. Or a classic, highly
effective opener in social settings is
using that mutual connection. Exactly.
Ask, "So, how do you know the host?"
This question immediately gives you a
shared topic, right? And it helps you
find that common ground straight away.
Yeah. discovering how you both know the
persons who brought you together. That's
a great starting point. Definitely.
Also, feel free to comment on the
environment itself, like the food or
music. Yeah. Have you tried these
snacks? They're delicious. Or this
playlist is awesome. I love this band.
An example from English Club was really
specific. Have you tried the cabbage
rolls? Huh. Okay. So, food and music are
usually safe, positive topics at a
party. Almost always. Simple questions
about the event work, too. Are you
having a good time or enjoying yourself?
Those usually get a yes. Right. Usually,
yeah, they're typically answered
positively, which keeps the mood good.
And then you can ask a follow-up
question. And if you spot something
appropriate to compliment on the person,
maybe a cool t-shirt, unique jewelry, go
for it. Yeah, just keep it appropriate.
Or if you overhear a snippet of
conversation that's relevant to you, you
could use that to join in politely, of
course. Like, oh, excuse me. I heard you
mention you went to UCLA. I actually
went there, too. Exactly like that.
Okay, let's quickly demonstrate this.
We'll do a short role play. We're at a
party hosted by uh let's call her Sarah.
I'll initiate. Sounds good. I'm standing
nearby. Maybe getting a drink. Smiling
friendly. Hi. I don't think we've met
yet. I'm Emma. Smiling back. Oh, hi
Emma. I'm Jake. Nice to meet you. Nice
to meet you too, Jake. This is a great
party, isn't it? Sarah's place is
lovely. It really is. Yeah, Sarah's a
fantastic host. I'm having a lot of fun
so far. Me, too. So, how do you know
Sarah? Uh, Sarah and I actually work
together. We've been on the same team
for about a year now. How about you? Oh,
cool. She's actually a college friend of
mine. We studied together way back when.
Oh, nice. So, you go way back then? We
do. Hey, have you tried these little
mini kiches? They're amazing. Seriously?
Oo, not yet, but they look really good.
I think I'll grab one now you mention
it. Thanks for the tip. You're welcome.
So, Jake, what do you do when you're not
uh attending fantastic parties like this
one? Chuckle slightly. Good question.
Well, I'm a software engineer. How about
you, Emma? Oh, wow. I'm a teacher. I
teach English, actually. Oh, really?
That's cool. That must be pretty
rewarding work. It is most days. I love
it. And software engineering sounds
well, fascinatingly complicated to me.
Huh. Yeah, it can be sometimes, but it
definitely keeps things interesting.
Looks around briefly. Well, listen. and
I should probably mingle a bit more. Say
hi to a few other people I see. But it
was really nice meeting you, Emma. You
too, Jake. Enjoy the rest of the party.
Thanks. You too. See how simple that
interaction was. It started with the
basic introduction, a smile. Yeah. And a
positive comment about the shared
environment, the party itself, which
flowed right into that key question for
this setting. How do you know Sarah?
Finding that common ground. And from
there, we transitioned easily into
standard small talk topics like jobs. We
kind of balanced asking questions with
sharing info. Yeah, like that
conversational ping pong we mentioned.
The comment about the food was just a
gentle pivot. Kept things light. And my
mentioning wanting to mingle provided a
natural and polite way to end that brief
chat. Not every interaction has to be
long, right? Exactly. The goal was just
to connect for a moment. That's a
success. So, the core phrases we used
there, I don't think we've met. How do
you know host? Have you tried the food?
And what do you do? Simple stuff. And
keeping it light, keeping it positive.
That seems key in social settings. Okay,
let's shift gears. Let's move to a
different environment. Professional
settings. Think the office, maybe a
networking event. The tone here needs to
be slightly more um maybe
formal but still friendly, right? Monday
morning at the office or maybe it's your
first day. How do the openers change
here? Well, a simple hi, how are you? or
good morning still works perfectly well.
Okay. A common and honestly pretty
reliable opener with colleagues is
asking about their weekend or their day.
Oh, right. So on a Monday, hey, good
morning. How was your weekend? It shows
you care beyond just the work tasks.
Yeah. One article highlighted asking,
"Did you do anything fun over the
weekend?" That can be a great prompt for
people to share a little personal story.
Exactly. And on a Friday, you can look
ahead. Got any plans for the weekend or
looking forward to the weekend? Neutral
workplace topics are also safe ground
according to the sources. Yeah, like
commenting on the busyiness level. Wow,
can you believe how busy we are today?
Or maybe something about the physical
environment like uh what do you think of
these new office chairs? Or have they
fixed the coffee machine yet? Ah, yeah.
Relatable office stuff. Now, if you're
new, you basically have an automatic
opener, a free pass almost, which is
just say it. Hi, I'm new here. My name
is Name. I just started this week in the
department. People are usually very
welcoming to a newcomer. That makes
sense. It gives them immediate context.
And a great question for a newcomer to
ask an existing employee is something
like, "How long have you been working
here?" Or maybe, "Have you been with the
company a while?" Why is that a good
question? Well, it subtly acknowledges
their experience. It shows respect for
their time there, and it often leads to
them sharing some insights or stories
about the company. Okay. And what about
networking events? That feels a bit
different again. A little. Well, yeah.
The introduction usually includes your
company name. Hi, I'm Jake. I work at
XYZ Corp. Right. Then you can follow up
with, what do you do? Or which company
are you with? If you're at a specific
conference session, you could ask, what
did you think of the keynote speech this
morning? Name tags are useful here, too,
aren't they? Definitely use the name and
company on the tag as your context. Hi,
name. I see you're with ABC, Inc. What
kind of work do you guys do there? Or,
how are you finding the conference so
far? Okay, let's try a short workplace
role play. Imagine I'm the new employee
and I meet you in the break room. All
right, sounds good. I'm just getting my
tea. Approaching with a friendly
expression. Uh, hi there. I don't think
we've met yet. I'm Jake. I just started
here this week, actually. Oh, hi Jake.
Nice to meet you. Hi, Emma. Welcome to
the team. Great to have you here.
Thanks. I really appreciate that. I'm uh
I'm really excited to be here. How long
you've been working here, if you don't
mind my asking. Oh, not at all. I've
been here for about four years now. I'm
over in the communications department.
Four years. Wow. Okay. So, you're
definitely an expert on the place then.
Laughs
gently. Well, I've seen a few
things. Seriously though, if you ever
have any questions about anything, just,
you know, don't hesitate to ask. Happy
to help. That's really kind of you.
Thanks. I might take you up on that. By
the way, how's your day going so far?
Pretty busy. It has been busy. Yeah. But
good. Just grabbing a quick tea break
before the next meeting. How about you?
Surviving the first week. Okay.
Definitely busy. Uh yeah, lots of new
names and systems to learn, but
everyone's been really helpful, which is
great. Oh, actually, I was wondering, do
you usually bring your own lunch or are
there good places to eat around here?
Good question. I usually bring mine just
out of habit, but yeah, there are a
couple of great little spots right
around the corner. There's a cafe that
does really good sandwiches just down
the street. Oh, good to know. Thanks for
the tip. Maybe I'll check that out later
this week then. You definitely should.
Well, my tea is ready now. But listen,
it was really nice meeting you, Jake.
Seriously, welcome aboard. You too,
Emma. Thanks so much for the chat and
the welcome. No problem. See you around.
Okay, breaking that down. You started
perfectly as the new employee, friendly
greeting, introduction, and that crucial
context. I just started this week,
right? And you responded warmly, gave
your name, and offered that welcome.
Then I used that uh that really good
newcomer question, how long have you
been working here? which as we said
invites sharing and subtly acknowledges
experience and the offer of help was a
nice welcoming touch too. Then we just
use that general versal question, how's
your day going? Works almost anywhere.
It does. And you mirrored that a bit by
mentioning your busy morning, showing
that shared experience of being busy.
And the question about lunch was
specific to the situation. We were in
the break room, and it led to practical
information, that cafe recommendation.
Exactly. Asking about food, coffee,
lunch spots at work. It's almost always
a safe and relatable topic. And the
ending felt pretty natural, prompted by
your tea being ready. polite closing.
So, key phrases from that workplace
scenario. I just started here. How long
have you been working here? How's your
day going? And asking about routines
like, do you usually bring lunch or go
out? Plus, remembering to introduce
yourself clearly and the potential to
offer or receive help is great for
newcomers. And while, you know, phrases
directly about work tasks exist, like,
"How's that project going?" It's for
starting conversations with people you
don't know well yet. These general
friendly openers are usually your best
bet, right? And at networking events,
maybe slightly more focused questions
like, "So, what got you into their
industry?" or "What do you enjoy most
about your work?" can spark deeper
replies, but maybe after you've made
that initial connection. Good point. You
need to feel the
situation. Okay, let's leave the office
now and talk about starting
conversations when you're traveling or
just out in daily life, often with
complete strangers. This can feel like
the biggest leap for some people. It
definitely can feel that way. Yeah.
Yeah. Because there's often no mutual
friend, no shared workplace to give you
an easy in. But the potential rewards
like, you know, meeting fascinating
people or getting local tips are really
high. That's something highlighted in
the travel resources you provided. The
absolute key here, as several sources
stress, is being mindful and respectful.
You've got to respect the other person's
time and space. Choose your moment
carefully. Exactly. Don't interrupt
someone who looks stressed, really busy,
or maybe has headphones on and is
clearly in their own world. So, look for
someone who seems maybe relaxed.
Perhaps alone in a communal area like a
park bench or a cafe. Maybe someone who
makes eye contact. Yes, those are good
signals. Once you find an appropriate
person and moment, a question related to
the shared situation is often the
easiest opener for travelers talking to
other travelers. A real classic is
simply, "Where are you from?" That seems
common. Yeah. Yeah. Is it seen as
intrusive? Generally, not in travel
contexts. No. It's very common. People
are often happy to share a little bit
about their home. And it usually leads
to a natural follow-up about where
you're from. Okay. What about other
location-based questions? Your sources
mention things like, "Is this your first
time here?" or "How long have you been
in this city country?" If it is their
first time and it's yours, too, boom,
you immediately have common ground as
fellow newcomers exploring. That's
handy. And what if the person is clearly
a local? Ah, then asking for
recommendations is a fantastic strategy
as mentioned in the travel guides. Like,
excuse me, do you happen to know a good
cafe near here? Or, I'm visiting for a
few days. What's a must-sea place you'd
recommend? Locals often genuinely enjoy
sharing advice about their city,
especially when a traveler shows genuine
curiosity. That phrase genuine curiosity
seems important here. It really is. It
shows you're interested in them or their
place, not just, you know, trying to
fill silence awkwardly. Okay. And what
about with other travelers? Say in a
hostile common room or on a long train
journey. Situational comments work well
there, too. Long journey ahead, huh? Or
maybe, how do you like this hostel
compared to others you've stayed in? And
for just like strangers in public,
waiting in a long queue or at a bus stop
that's taking forever, right? Commenting
on that shared, often slightly annoying
experience can break the ice quite
effectively. The English Club examples
included things like, "Wow, I didn't
expect it to be this busy today." Or,
"Looks like we'll be here a while, huh?"
Kind of bonding over the shared misery.
Huh, exactly. It's a way to sort of
commiserate and connect over that common
situation. Okay, let's try a travel role
play. Imagine we're both on a train,
maybe got a few hours left on the
journey. Start this time. Okay, sounds
good. I'm settled in my seat, maybe
looking out the window, smiling gently.
Uh, excuse me. Is this seat free by any
chance? Oh, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Go right ahead. Moves the small bag
slightly. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Sits down. Maybe a brief comfortable
silence. Yeah. Chew. Looks like we've
got a bit of a ride ahead of us, huh? We
certainly do. I think it's about four
more hours to Springfield. Plenty of
time to watch the scenery go by.
Exactly. It's actually quite beautiful
today, isn't it? By the way, I'm Jake.
Nice to meet you, Jake. I'm Emma. Nice
to meet you, too, Emma. Are you heading
all the way to Springfield as well, or
getting off sooner? No, I'm going all
the way. It's actually my first time
visiting Springfield. I'm quite excited.
Oh, interesting. Hey, it's my first
time, too. Small world. I'm really
looking forward to seeing the uh the old
town square I've heard about. Me, too. I
saw pictures online. It looked really
charming. So, where are you traveling
from today, Jake? I came up from
Toronto, Canada this morning. Just doing
a bit of traveling around this region
for a week or so. How about you? Oh,
wow. Toronto. Nice. I'm from Denver,
Colorado. Also doing some traveling
though. I'm actually heading back home
from Springfield in a couple of days.
Oh, Denver. I hear that's a beautiful
city, especially with the mountains
nearby. Are you excited to head back or
kind of sad your trip is ending? Uh,
yeah, a little bit of both, you know.
I've had a great trip, met some lovely
people, but home is always nice, too.
Toronto sounds amazing, though. I've
always wanted to visit Canada. You
definitely should sometime. Uh, well,
hey, since we've got a few hours here,
maybe we could uh trade tips or stories
about what we've enjoyed on our trip so
far or what we're planning to see in
Springfield. Oh yeah, that sounds like a
great idea. I'd love that. Okay, see how
that flowed. It started with just a
simple, practical courtesy question
about the seat. Very low risk, right?
Then a situational comment about the
shared experience, the long ride that
got a response and opened the door. And
then we introduced ourselves because,
well, it seemed likely we'd be sharing
this space for a while, so it felt
natural. Definitely. Then came those
logical questions about our destination
which led to discovering that common
ground both being firsttime visitors and
the classic where are you from followed
pretty naturally after that. Yeah, those
initial questions about origin and
destination are really standard traveler
small talk. They helped us share a bit
more about ourselves in our travel
plans. And my final suggestion to trade
tips and stories gave the conversation a
clear topic and purpose for the next
little while. Exactly. And if one of us
had been a local, the conversation
probably would have naturally shifted
towards the local giving
recommendations, which is also great.
Now, a really crucial piece of advice
emphasized in your sources for these
situations. Safety. Yes, absolutely
critical. When you're talking to
strangers, especially when traveling,
you need to stay safe and always trust
your instincts. Most people are
friendly, right? Overwhelmingly, yes.
Most people are genuinely friendly and
mean well. But if something feels off or
maybe someone starts asking overly
personal questions way too soon, it's
perfectly okay to keep your answers
short or just politely end the
conversation. Find an excuse to move
away if needed. So, don't feel pressured
to share like exactly where you're
staying or your full itinerary right
away. No, definitely not immediately.
Keep things general and friendly at
first. Build a little trust before
sharing more details. Okay, that's
important. But, you know, don't let
safety concerns completely prevent you
from trying at all. These kinds of
conversations can be absolutely
wonderful ways to practice your English
and create really memorable moments. And
remember that idea of just being
curious. Sometimes simply commenting on
something interesting someone is doing
can be a great opener. Like what? Like,
excuse me, how are you liking that book?
I've been meaning to read it myself.
Right? Or maybe someone's sketching in a
park. Wow, that's a beautiful drawing.
Right? Curiosity combined with kindness.
That often seems to be a winning
combination, doesn't it? It really does.
Okay. So, we've covered face to face.
Now, let's take these principles online,
right? More and more communication
happens virtually now, doesn't it? On
social media, language exchange apps,
forums. The principles from your sources
are pretty similar, but the delivery
obviously is different. That's all
typing. What are the pros and cons
there? Well, the advantage is you
definitely have more time to think, to
compose your message, maybe edit it
before you hit send. Okay. Less pressure
in the moment. Exactly. The disadvantage
though is you completely lack tone of
voice and body language. So your written
words have to do all the work they need
to be really clear and sound friendly.
So tip number one, which seems critical
in the sources for online chat, always
introduce yourself or give context in
that very first message. Yes, this is so
important. Just a simple hi or hello
from a complete stranger online can feel
well a bit weird or even slightly
suspicious sometimes. People wonder who
is this? What do they want? Right. So
instead of just hi you need something
more. Definitely a message saying hi I'm
name I saw your post about topic in the
group name forum and I found it really
interesting. That works much better. It
was the reason right away. Exactly. Or
for language practice maybe. Hello I'm
name. I'm also learning English and I
saw your profile says you are too. Would
you maybe like to practice chatting
sometime? These immediately provide the
why and the context. So referencing that
common interest or
context, the forum, the app, the shared
hobby is key online, just like
mentioning the host at a party is key in
person. Precisely. It tells them why
you're reaching out to them
specifically. Okay. What about
compliments online? Do they work? They
definitely can. Yes. provided they are
again sincere and appropriate to the
context. Keep it respectful, not overly
personal, especially at first. Examples,
maybe something like your profile says
you're a fan of classical music. Me too.
Any favorite composers? Or that photo
you shared at the beach is absolutely
stunning. Where was it taken? Okay. Tip
three. Try to include a question in your
opening message if you can. Yeah, this
is a good one. Why? Because a simple
statement like, "I like your photo,"
might just get a thanks in reply and
then the conversation dies. Exactly. But
if you ask, "I like your photo of Paris.
The light is beautiful." Where exactly
was that taken? Was it near the river?
That invites a more detailed response.
Makes sense. Tip four, keep that first
message relatively short. Yes, maybe one
or two clear sentences. You don't want
to overwhelm them with a huge block of
text right off the bat. Keep it easy to
read and respond to. Good point. Yeah.
Tip five, be patient with replies.
Definitely. People have lives. They
might not be online. Avoid sending
multiple follow-up messages like, "Or,"
did you get my message? Yeah. If they
don't respond right away, give it some
time. Okay. And tip six, be mindful of
your tone in text. This seems tricky
without voice. It is. You need to use
polite language. Sometimes emojis or
smileys can help convey friendliness
where your voice and face can't.
Phrasing makes a difference, too, right?
huge difference. Compare just typing
recommend English podcasts with
something like, "Hi, I'm looking for
some good English podcasts to listen to.
I saw you mentioned you enjoy them. Do
you happen to have any favorites you
could recommend? Thanks." Yeah. The
second one is much warmer and more
likely to get a helpful reply. Much more
polite. And a quick note on clarity,
especially for English learners chatting
online. Probably best to use full words
and standard grammar, right? Generally,
yes. Using you instead of just you
remembering please and thank you. Maybe
avoid complex slang or abbreviations you
aren't 100% sure of just to prevent
misunderstanding. Clarity is key. Okay,
let's simulate a quick online chat
starter maybe on a language exchange
app. You initiate this time. All right,
I'll message you typing, "Hi, Jake. My
name's Emma. I see from your profile
you're learning English, too, which is
great. Would you maybe like to practice
chatting together sometime?" Typing,
"Hi, Emma." That sounds great. I'd be
happy to practice. Thanks for reaching
out. Where are you from, if you don't
mind me asking? Typing. Not at all. I'm
from Italy. How about you? Typing. Cool.
I'm from Brazil. Nice to meet you.
Typing. Nice to meet you, too, Jake. So,
what kind of things do you usually do to
practice your English as do you listen
to podcasts much? I find them really
helpful. Simulated chat ends. Okay. So,
you see the pattern there. Yeah. I
introduced myself, gave the context.
We're both learning English on this app.
Suggested an activity practice together.
And added that smiley to show
friendliness. And I responded
positively, introduced myself to and
immediately asked a common appropriate
get to know you question for that
context. Where are you from? Yeah. And
we used clear complete sentences.
Exactly. And then the conversation could
easily flow into finding common ground
or a topic to discuss like how we
practice English which led to the idea
of podcasts. Okay. And on social media,
messaging about shared content seems
like a good approach, like, "Hello, I
saw the amazing travel photos you posted
from Japan. Japan is super high on my
list to visit. How did you enjoy your
trip to Tokyo? Any highlights?" Perfect
example. Or in a group chat, maybe
introducing yourself when you first
joined. Hi everyone, I'm Emma from
Mexico. I just joined this group because
I'm hoping to improve my English
vocabulary. Really nice to meet you all.
Simple, clear, gives context. What about
professional online contexts like
LinkedIn? Yeah, that might require a bit
more formality, maybe commenting on or
messaging someone about an article they
wrote or shared, but the core idea of
having a clear context and a specific
polite reason for reaching out still
absolutely remains. You wouldn't just
say, "Hi." Got it? So, the online tips
summarized. Introduce yourself clearly.
State your context or common interest.
Ask a relevant question in that first
message if you can. Be polite and
mindful of tone. Keep it relatively
short initially. Be patient and please
don't just send a contextless hi.
Exactly. Give people a reason to reply.
Okay. Wow. We've covered a lot of ground
based on the sources you provided. Now,
it's time for you, the listener, to
maybe put this into practice mentally.
This is just a short interactive
segment. Yeah, let's try this. We'll
give you a scenario. We'll pause for
maybe 5 seconds for you to think of an
opener and then we'll suggest a few
possibilities based on the strategies
we've been discussing. Ready? Give it a
try. Scenario one. You're sitting in a
coffee shop. You'd like to chat with the
person at the next table. They're alone.
They look relaxed. What could you say?
Pause. 5 seconds. Okay. What did you
come up with? You could maybe comment on
something they're doing if it feels
appropriate. Like, excuse me. I couldn't
help but notice you're reading book
title. I've heard such good things about
that book. How are you liking it so far?
Or much simpler, just comment on the
shared environment. This coffee shop has
a really nice atmosphere, doesn't it?
Or, "Wow, their coffee smells amazing
today." Okay, scenario two. You've just
joined a local Meetup group. Let's say
it's for hiking. You're standing next to
someone new before the hike starts. How
do you strike up a conversation? Pause.
5 seconds. All right. Maybe a simple
introduction with context. Hi, I'm Emma.
Is this your first time hiking with this
group, too? If they say yes, great.
You're both newbies together. Instant
common ground. Exactly. If they say no,
you can ask, "Oh, cool. How long have
you been coming?" Or, "Do you hike
often?" Or you could comment on the
activity itself. this looks like it's
going to be a beautiful trail today. Or
maybe ask what made you decide to dime
this particular hiking group. Good ones.
Scenario three. You're at a professional
event, maybe a conference or a workshop.
You're sitting next to someone you
haven't met before the session starts.
How do you initiate? Pause 5 seconds.
Okay, some safe openers here would
include introducing yourself and asking
about the event. Hi, I'm Jake. Are you
enjoying the workshop so far? Or, what
did you think of that last session we
were in? You could also ask about their
reason for being there. What brought you
to this conference? Or if it's
appropriate and maybe visible on a name
tag, which company are you with? All
right, last one. Scenario four. You've
just joined an online forum specifically
for English learners. You want to write
your very first post to introduce
yourself to the community. What key
information should you probably include?
Pause 5 seconds. Okay. For an online
intro post, you could write something
like, "Hello everyone. My name is Emma
and I'm joining you from Italy. I just
found this group and I'm really excited
because I'm looking for people to
practice my English speaking skills
with. Looking forward to chatting with
you all or maybe. Hi folks, I'm Jake
from Brazil. So happy to find this
forum. My main goal right now is to
learn new vocabulary every week. So any
tips are welcome. Hope to talk with you
all soon. So how did you do? We hope you
tried thinking of some openers for those
situations. Remember there are many,
many possible ways to start
conversations. Just thinking about them
helps prepare you. It really does. And
practice is absolutely key here. One tip
is to actually practice saying some of
these phrases out loud, even when you're
by yourself. Yeah. Why does that help?
It just makes them feel a bit more
natural, less awkward. When you actually
need them in a real conversation, they
roll off the tongue easier. That makes
sense. And practicing with a friend or
maybe a language partner, doing little
role plays like we just did, that's an
excellent way to build comfort and
confidence before you try it out with
strangers. Definitely. Okay, let's do a
quick recap then of the key strategies
and maybe some of those useful phrases
we pulled from your sources. All right,
quick rundown of the core advice from
the materials we looked at. Be friendly
and try to project confidence. Smile,
make some eye contact. Use open body
language. It really makes you seem more
approachable. Second, start with simple
small talk. Those light topics, the
weather, the environment you're in, the
immediate situation, they're safe and
easy openers.
Third, use those open-ended questions
whenever possible. They encourage more
than just a yes or no, and remember to
follow up on their responses. Keep that
conversation pingpong going back and
forth. Fourth, look for common ground.
Ask questions or make observations that
might reveal shared interests,
experiences, or connections you can
build on. That makes conversation much
easier. Fifth, give genuine, appropriate
compliments. They make people feel good.
They show you're paying attention and
they can easily open the door to a chat.
And sixth, remember to adapt your
approach to the setting. Casual social
settings feel different from
professional networking, which feels
different from talking to a stranger on
a train, which is different again from
online chats. The sources provided
specific phrases and strategies tailored
for each. And just to remind you of some
of those specific phrases drawn from
your sources categorized loosely for
introducing yourself. Okay, simple stuff
like hi, hi, hello, my name's general
greetings and questions. Hi, how are
you? How's your day going? How's it
going? Maybe a bit more informal weather
or environment comments. Beautiful day,
isn't it? Can you believe this weather?
This place is really nice. For events or
social gatherings, how do you know the
host? Are you enjoying yourself? Have
you tried the food drink? Great party,
huh? for work or school settings? Have
you worked here long? Did you do
anything fun over the weekend? What do
you do for a living? What are you
studying? Looking forward to the
weekend. For travel or public
encounters. Where are you from? This is
your first time here. How do you like
the city? Wow, the bus is really running
late today, huh? That book looks
interesting. Combining compliments with
intros. That's a great item. Like a
scarf or jacket. Where'd you get it? By
the way, I'm name. I loved your comment
in the meeting earlier. here. Your
English is really good. And for online
starters, hi, I saw your profile post
about topic. Hello, I'm name I'd love to
practice English together. Hey everyone,
I'm new here in the group. Saying these
kinds of phrases out loud like you
suggested really does help commit them
to memory and makes them feel less well
foreign when you actually need to use
them. Okay, final thoughts then based on
the overall insights from your sources,
what are the big takeaways? Well, I
think one is don't be overly afraid of
awkwardness. If it happens, it's usually
pretty brief, and often only you notice
it. That's true. Most people are
actually quite receptive if you approach
them kindly and simply. Don't take a
short response personally. Maybe they're
just busy or shy themselves. Listen
actively. Show you're engaged. Stick to
safe, light topics. Initially, weather,
surroundings, hobbies, work, travel.
Maybe avoid very sensitive topics with
strangers, right? like politics,
religion, personal finances. Probably
not great for first chats. Definitely
not. And if you're ever completely
stuck, remember a smile, a simple hello,
and a question about the immediate
shared situation. That's the nearly
foolproof way to start. Yes. And maybe
the absolute most important takeaway
from all the material is simply to try.
You have to practice. That's the key
that builds confidence over time.
Absolutely. Think about it. Every
significant connection we make, whether
it ends up being a lifelong friendship,
a valuable professional contact, or just
a really memorable interaction with a
stranger, it almost always starts with
that small initial moment. Just saying
hello. Just saying hello. That little
bit of effort to open the door to break
the ice. Yeah, it really can lead to
some truly great things down the line.
Well, that pretty much wraps up our deep
dive into starting conversations based
on all the excellent sources you
provided. It was a great topic to
explore. We truly hope that you
listening found the insights and the
practical tips helpful and maybe, just
maybe, you feel a little bit more
confident now about initiating those
conversations in English. Yeah. The next
time you spot an opportunity, maybe a
new person at an event, a fellow
traveler on the bus, someone interesting
online, we really encourage you to just,
you know, go for it. Take the plunge.
Exactly. Use one of the phrases or
strategies we talked about. You might be
really pleasantly surprised by the
positive response you get. And please
remember that every single conversation,
even if it feels imperfect or maybe it's
super short, it's still valuable
practice. Don't get discouraged if it
doesn't go exactly as you planned in
your head. That's so important. Give
yourself credit just for making the
effort. It genuinely does get easier the
more you do it. You build that muscle.
Making that initial attempt really is
the biggest hurdle for most people. With
practice, you'll start to develop a more
natural feel for how to open
conversations in all sorts of different
situations. You really will. Before we
wrap up completely, just a quick

Keep practicing that first hello. You've
got this. And happy chatting in
Welcome to English phrases hub and I'm
really looking forward to exploring
something useful with you today. It's
great to be here to uh guide you through
this topic. Today we're doing a sort of
calm friendly deep dive into learning
English effectively specifically looking
towards 2025. So whether you're just
starting out maybe beginner level or
perhaps you're more intermediate we've
got some ideas. Exactly. We'll look at
why now 2025 is actually a really good
time to learn. And we'll cover modern
resources, ways to practice, and
importantly, how to stay motivated. You
know, definitely we want to make it
clear, easy to follow, show you how
accessible learning English can be now.
Yeah, the technology and resources
available today, they make a huge
difference. We know learning a language
can feel well a bit daunting sometimes.
It can, but we're here to break it down.
We'll probably be about uh 30 minutes
around that. Yeah. And the focus is
really on making it effective but also
hopefully enjoyable too. And remember,
you're definitely not alone in this.
Yeah. Oh, absolutely not. Millions of
people are learning English right now.
It's that global language thing, isn't
it? Spoken by over one and a half
billion people. Think about that. One
and a half billion. It just opens up so
many
opportunities for work, travel, or exams
or just for fun connecting with people.
Exactly. So, get comfortable. Maybe grab
a notebook if that helps you. Yeah.
Let's start with this idea of the 2025
advantage. Yeah. Why is right now such a
good moment? Well, the big thing I think
about learning English in 2025 is just
the sheer volume of resources you have
right at your fingertips compared to the
past. You mean? Oh, completely. Think
about smartphones, uh, widespread Wi-Fi,
right? Everyone's connected pretty much.
And that means you can learn anytime,
anywhere. Waiting for a bus on your
lunch break. So, you just squeeze in a
quick lesson. You can you've got instant
access, lessons, English content from
all over the world. Like what kind of
content? Well, you could be watching a
quick video from someone in London or uh
listening to a podcast from New York,
reading an article from Toronto. It's
all there. English really is that
bridge, isn't it? Connecting that huge
global community. One and a half billion
speakers. Yeah, it's massive. But it's
not just about accessing stuff, is it?
It's the type of help available, too.
That's a really key point. The tools and
the support you get now in 2025, they go
way beyond, you know, old textbooks and
classrooms, right? We've got this
amazing range of modern tools, apps,
websites, videos, podcasts. They often
make learning much more interactive and
maybe even fun. Dare I say it, yes, fun.
That's good to hear because it shouldn't
feel like a total chore. Are these tools
expensive? Many are actually free or at
least very affordable. Think about all
the educational videos on YouTube.
Totally free. True. And lots of language
apps have really good free versions.
Plus, you've got online communities,
language exchange forums, often free,
too. It's like you said, having a
library and maybe a personal teacher or
practice partner right in your pocket.
That's a great image. What about
motivation? That's always a big hurdle.
How does today's world help with that?
Well, this is interesting because
English is just so integrated into our
daily lives online now. You mean like
music and movies? Exactly. music,
movies, gaming, social media. English
isn't just something you study. It's
part of the online culture. So that
constant exposure can actually motivate
you. I think so because you're enjoying
something in English, maybe a song or
YouTube video, and you start picking
things up almost without trying.
Learning without realizing you're
learning. The dream kind of. You might
learn a new phrase from a YouTuber you
follow or understand some slang from a
song. It feels more natural. Yeah, I can
see that. You might learn funny phrases
from Tik Toks or YouTube shorts or
something. Precisely. So, to sum up that
2025 advantage, it's this mix, isn't it?
Yeah. Global connection, powerful tech
in your pocket, and English being part
of everyday online life. It makes
learning easier and frankly more
exciting. Definitely sounds like a good
time to jump in. Absolutely. So, maybe
now we can dig into some of those
specific tools in tech. Perfect. Let's
look at the modern resources that can
boost your English. apps, online tools.
Have you listening now tried any of
these? It's interesting with language
apps, things like dual Dualingo, Babel,
Memorize, they often use what's called
uh gamification. Gamification. Yeah.
Like making it a game. Exactly. So,
learning vocabulary, grammar, even
pronunciation feels less like study,
more like well playing short exercises,
points, rewards. Ah, so it keeps you
engaged. That's the idea. It can really
help with motivation, keeping you coming
back. So it's not just like flash cards
on a screen. Oh, no. These apps usually
adapt to your level, too. So they get
harder as you get better. Smart. Yeah.
And they have points, maybe streaks for
daily practice, reminders, trying to
keep you on track. And getting feedback
must be important. Do they do that? Yes.
Usually instant feedback on answers,
sometimes even on your pronunciation.
Wow. And many use AI artificial
intelligence to personalize the lessons,
focusing where you need more help. So,
it tailor it to you pretty much. It's
worth trying a few different apps
honestly to see what style fits you
best. Okay. Now, AI, it's everywhere.
You mentioned AI chat bots or tutors.
How do they work for learning English,
right? This is a really exciting area.
AI chat bots like ChatGpt or others,
they offer a new way to practice
conversation. You mean you can actually
talk to them? You can either by typing
or increasingly by voice. Really? A
spoken conversation with an AI. Yeah.
And the key thing is the AI adapts to
your English level. It can give you
feedback corrections right away. So,
what could you practice? Well, you could
ask it to check your sentences or
practice specific situations like uh
ordering food in a restaurant. That
sounds incredibly useful. Like having a
practice partner available 24/7.
Exactly. And a very patient one, too.
Uh-huh. True. You could just start
simply, "Hello, I want to practice
English. Can you help me?" See what
happens. I might try that. Okay. Besides
conversations, what about pronunciation?
That's tricky for many learners. It is.
And technology can really help here,
too. There are apps like ELSA speak, for
example. ELSA speak. Yeah. And even some
tools built into, say, Google search.
They listen to you speak. They listen.
Give you specific feedback. ELSA uses AI
to analyze how you say words and it can
give you tips like how to move your
mouth or tongue differently. So, I keep
saying a word wrong, like comfortable.
Exactly. An app like that might pinpoint
which sound is off and tell you how to
fix it. It's very targeted. Wow. And
we'll talk about another tool, Yugish,
in a bit, which is great for hearing
real pronunciations, but even just
talking to your phone, many have
built-in tools now. Worth checking out.
Good tip. What about newer tech like uh
virtual reality VR? Ah yes, VR is
becoming more accessible using headsets
like the MetaQuest ones. There are
language learning apps for VR like Mly
VR. They put you in simulated
environments like a virtual coffee shop.
Exactly. Or an airport, a hotel, and you
practice conversations in that setting.
It feels very real. That sounds
incredibly immersive, like you're
actually there. It really is. You get
feedback within that simulation. But you
know, even without a VR headset, some
platforms use 360 degree videos to give
you a similar feeling of immersion. So
technology is making it all much more
interactive, more realistic. Definitely,
it's changing how we can practice. So
with all these options, apps, AI, VR,
what's your advice for someone wanting
to start? It sounds like a lot. It can
seem like a lot. I'd say just try one
new thing, maybe one new tool a week.
Spend just 10 minutes a day on an app or
have one short chat with an AI. See how
it feels. Small steps. Exactly.
Consistency is more important than doing
everything at once. Find what you
actually enjoy using and what helps you.
Different things work for different
people. That's really practical advice.
Start small, be consistent, find what
works. Precisely. Okay, so we've covered
these specific tools, but what about
just the internet like YouTube? There's
so much free stuff there. Yes. And that
leads us perfectly into our next section
using immersive resources. How YouTube
and other online media can be amazing
learning tools, right? Because you can
learn and be entertained. That's the
beauty of it. If you find videos you
genuinely enjoy, they become really
powerful learning tools without feeling
like work. So YouTube, yeah, it's huge.
Where does an English learner even
start? Well, first off, it's an
incredible free resource. There are
channels specifically for teaching
English and they put out regular
content. Any recommendations? Sure. Uh
BBC Learning English is great. They have
short daily lessons. Speakers are
usually very clear, often with
subtitles. Okay. BBC Learning English.
Then there's English with Lucy. She
focuses on British English. Gives lots
of tips on sounding natural common
mistakes. Very easy to follow. Good for
British English. And for American
English, uh Speak English with Vanessa
is very popular. covers everyday topics,
encourages you to speak along. So, BBC,
Lucy, Vanessa,
good starting points. Definitely
subscribe to a couple, watch regularly,
and don't just watch passively. What do
you mean? Pause the video. If you hear a
new phrase, pause it. Try saying it out
loud. Repeat it. Actively engage.
Exactly. And remember that slow down
feature on YouTube. Oh, yeah. The
playback speed. Super useful if the
person is speaking too fast for you at
first. Great tip. Okay. What about
videos not made for
learners like regular vlogs or
something? Yes, this is where you get
real immersion. Channels like um Easy
English, they do street interviews. Oh,
I've seen those. Right. With subtitles,
you hear real people, real
conversations, different accents. It's
fantastic exposure. So, just find stuff
you're interested in. Exactly. Watch
vlogs about travel, tech, cooking,
gaming, whatever you like, but in
English. Use subtitles at first. Yeah,
start with subtitles if you need them.
Then gradually try watching without them
or maybe just with English subtitles.
See how much you understand from context
and you start picking up natural phrases
that way. Absolutely. You hear how
people really talk. Maybe someone says
I'm off to instead of I am going to,
right? Or slang like if something costs
an arm and a leg. You learn it from the
situation. Learning in context. Makes
sense. Are there other YouTube features
we can use? We'll definitely use the
captions. Close captions. Pause and
repeat is your friend. And try
shadowing. Shadowing. What's that? It's
where you listen to a sentence. Pause.
And then immediately try to repeat it
exactly as the speaker said it, matching
their pronunciation, their intonation.
Like mimicking them. Precisely. Like if
they say, "Hello everyone, welcome back
to my channel." You pause and say,
"Hello everyone. Welcome back to my
channel." Trying to sound just like
them. Okay, that sounds like really
active practice. It is great for
pronunciation and fluency. Now, you
mentioned Uglish earlier. Yes. How does
that work with YouTube? Uglish is
brilliant. It's a website and an app,
too. I think you type in an English word
or phrase. Any word. Any word or phrase,
and it searches YouTube and instantly
finds loads of short video clips where
real people are saying that exact word
or phrase. Wow. So, you hear it in lots
of different contexts and accents.
Exactly. Say you're unsure about
environment or how to say nice to meet
you. Naturally, Uglish shows you example
after example from real videos. That
sounds incredibly useful for
pronunciation and just hearing how
sentences flow. It really is. I highly
recommend trying with a tricky word.
Just type it in and see. Okay, I'll
definitely check that out. What about
music and movies on YouTube? Also,
great. Find lyric videos for songs you
like. Sing along. Great for rhythm and
pronunciation. Good idea. Watch movie
clips. See how people talk in different
scenarios. Some channels even break down
movie scenes to teach English. So much
potential there. Yeah, but you said
don't just watch passively, right? It's
tempting to just put on a movie and
relax, which is fine sometimes, but for
learning, try to be more active.
Meaning, pause, ask yourself, did I
understand that? Try repeating lines.
Maybe keep a little notebook nearby for
new words. Okay? And afterwards, maybe
try to summarize the video in English.
Just speak it out loud or write a few
sentences. does it helps solidify
everything. So, the main message is
surround yourself with English media you
enjoy, but engage with it actively. You
got it. It's like a free immersion
course right there online. Even 15
minutes a day of active watching or
listening can make a real difference.
That's really encouraging. Okay, we know
why now is good. We know the tools and
resources. What about actually doing the
practice? How do we build fluency? Yes,
let's talk about practice strategies.
This is about building those habits that
really improve your speaking, listening,
reading, and writing. Okay, sounds
crucial. What's the number one thing for
effective practice? I'd say consistency.
It's probably the most important factor.
Consistency over intensity. Absolutely.
Doing a little bit every day, say 15
minutes, is much much better than trying
to cram in two hours once a week. Okay.
Think about how to weave it into your
routine. Vocabulary at breakfast,
podcast on the commute. Find those
pockets of time like exercise, right?
Little and often builds the muscle.
Exactly like that. Find a time that
works for you and try to stick to it.
Make it a habit. Makes sense. Yeah. Now,
speaking, that's often the big goal. How
do we practice speaking effectively? The
key is just do it. Speak as much as
possible. And please don't worry about
making mistakes. Everyone does. Easier
said than done sometimes. I know. I
know. But look for chances. Practice
with friends, learning English, family.
Maybe use language exchange apps or
websites to find partners. Join online
conversation groups. Okay, what if you
don't have anyone to practice with
easily? Practice alone. Seriously,
describe what you're doing as you do it.
I'm making coffee now. Talk about your
day out loud. Talking to yourself. Yeah,
it feels weird at first maybe, but it
works. You can even record yourself on
your phone. Record yourself? Why? So you
can listen back, hear your own
pronunciation, notice things you want to
improve. It's really insightful, but
again, mistakes are fine. They're
learning opportunities. Okay. Embrace
the mistakes. Got it. Any other
techniques for fluency? Yes. Try to get
into the habit of thinking in English.
Thinking in English. How? Start simple.
Just mentally label things around you.
Chair, window, computer. Then move on to
simple sentences in your head. It's
raining today. I need my umbrella. What
should I have for lunch? Ah, so you
bypass the translation step from your
native language. Exactly. It trains your
brain to work directly in English. It
makes speaking much smoother and faster
over time because you're not constantly
translating back and forth. That sounds
powerful. Okay. What about balancing the
skills? Listening, reading, writing,
speaking. Yeah, it's important to mix it
up. Don't just focus on speaking, even
if that's your main goal, right? Listen
actively podcasts, music, radio, read
news articles, maybe simpler ones like
from VA, learning English, blogs, social
media. Write, keep a simple journal,
message friends in English, and speak,
of course. VA learning English. Good tip
for simpler news. Yeah. And remember
shadowing for speaking practice. That
helps listening, too. Varying your
practice keeps it interesting and builds
all-around communication skills. Okay.
Mix it. One more thing. Using what you
learn. Crucial. Don't just learn a new
word or phrase and then forget it. Use
it. Actively try to put it into your own
sentences in your speaking or writing as
soon as possible. So if I learn to
figure something out, try to use it. I
need to figure out how this app works or
I finally figured out the answer. Make
it your own. Play with the language.
Okay. Use it or lose it. Basically
pretty much. So the best practice
strategy is one that you find well
enjoyable enough to stick with.
Sustainable. Yes. Find that balance
between fun stuff and challenging stuff.
If you're busy, integrate it. English
music while cooking. Follow English
accounts on social media. Think it in.
Exactly. And just be patient. Fluency
doesn't happen overnight. But every
single practice session is progress.
Remember that. That's really important
to keep in mind. Okay, final stretch.
How do we stay motivated and confident
through all this? It can be a long
journey. It really can be. And
motivation definitely goes up and down.
That's totally normal. So having ways to
keep going and build that self-belief is
key. Absolutely. So what are your top
tips for staying motivated? First,
always remember why you started. What's
your personal reason for learning
English? For a job, travel, connecting
with family, whatever it is, write it
down. Make it your phone wallpaper.
Remind yourself often. Keep the goal in
sight. Exactly. And set small,
achievable goals along the way. Not just
become fluent, but maybe learn 50 new
words this month or confidently
introduce myself or finish level three
of my app. Break it down. Yeah. And
celebrate when you reach those small
goals. It builds momentum. Feels good.
Nice. And making it fun helps
motivation, too, right? Definitely. Link
English to things you already enjoy.
Love cooking, find recipes in English,
love gaming, play in English. Makes
sense. What about dealing with those
inevitable mistakes? How does that
affect confidence? Try really try to
reframe mistakes. See them not as
failures but as proof that you're
trying, you're learning. They show you
what you need to work on. Okay. Mistakes
are learning opportunities. Yes. And
track your progress somehow. Keep that
journal. Record yourself speaking now
and then compare it to recordings from
months ago. You will see improvement and
that's a huge confidence booster seeing
how far you've come. Exactly. And maybe
occasionally gently push your comfort
zone. Leave a comment on a video in
English. Try asking a tourist for simple
directions if appropriate. Small wins
build confidence. Good idea. What about
other people? Does community help?
Hugely. Connect with other learners.
Online forums, local meetups, maybe
share tips, struggles, successes.
Knowing you're not alone is really
motivating. Sharing the journey. Yeah.
And finally, reward yourself. After a
good study week or reaching a goal,
treat yourself to something nice.
Acknowledge your effort. Positive
reinforcement. I love it. Any final
thoughts on motivation and confidence?
Maybe just let's try this. Wherever you
are listening, just take a breath and
maybe repeat after me, even silently in
your head. I am improving my English
every day. Okay, I'm confident and I
will keep practicing. Believing in
yourself makes a real difference.
Everyone learns differently at their own
speed. You're putting in the effort and
that's fantastic. Be proud of that. Keep
going. That's a wonderful positive note
to lean on. Thank you for all of that.
My pleasure. Okay, so let's quickly
recap this deep dive into learning
English effectively in 2025, right? We
looked at the 2025 advantage, why now is
great with all the resources and global
connection. Mhm. We covered modern
tools, apps, AI chat bots, pronunciation
helpers, even a bit about VR and how to
use immersive resources like YouTube
specific channels, real life content,
and that cool UGlish tool. Then we
talked practice strategies. Consistency
is king. Speak often. Try thinking in
English. Mix your skills and actively
use what you learn. And finally, those
vital tips for motivation and
confidence. Remember your why, set small
goals, enjoy it, embrace mistakes, track
progress, find community, and reward
yourself. And remember that tech can
give you feedback and support along the
way. Don't forget those YouTube channels
or Uglish for pronunciation help. Yeah,
surrounding yourself with English you
actually enjoy makes such a difference.
And weaving those practice habits into
your daily life. small consistent steps
and always be kind to yourself. Mistakes
are part of it. Celebrate the progress.
It's your journey. Go at your own pace
and try to enjoy it. We're genuinely
proud of you for tuning in and wanting
to improve. Um, how to learn English
effectively, like right now in 2025.
Yeah. And we're diving into a specific
source for this one, a video called How
I'd learn English in 2025 if I were
starting now. Seems pretty relevant.
Definitely. Mhm. So our mission today is
basically to pull out the best bits, the
key insights and you know the real
practical advice from that video, right?
We want to show you how you can use all
the well the amazing tools and resources
we have available today to make learning
English smarter, maybe even more fun and
definitely more effective because
honestly the video makes a great point
right at the start which is that now
2025. It's just arguably the best time
ever to start learning a language
because of all the tech and stuff
available. Exactly. It's just so much
more accessible than it used to be. A
huge advantage. Okay, so where does the
videos suggest we start? What's the
first big shift? Well, one of the first
core ideas is about um moving away from
old habits, like stressing too much
about memorizing grammar rules in
isolation or just endless vocabulary
lists. I remember doing that. Yeah,
exactly. Those lists you just stare at.
The video argues you shouldn't get
completely bogged down in that. So, it's
not saying ignore grammar and vocab. No,
no, not at all. It's about how you learn
them. The advice is to focus on learning
grammar and vocabulary in context. in
context meaning meaning seeing and
hearing words and grammar used in you
know real sentences real situations like
in stories or conversations or videos
unless you're studying for a specific
grammar test maybe right that's the
caveat if you need to know the explicit
rule for an exam okay but for actually
using the language context is key and
the payoff for that approach is you
learn more naturally you start to get a
real feel for the language how it flows
what sounds right it's not just abstract
rules or random words. Yeah, that makes
sense. I liked the practical tip in the
video for vocabulary. The whole use it
immediately idea. Oh, yeah. That's a
good one. The examples were great. Heard
scrub on a cooking show. Say, "I'm going
to scrub the dishes out loud." Exactly.
Or you hear the word cozy. You find
something cozy like a hoodie, and say,
"I feel cozy in this hoodie." Right. It
links directly to that core learning
principle. Use it or lose it. So, it's
not enough just to write it down. Nope.
The video really emphasizes active use.
Say it, write a sentence with it, maybe
post it somewhere online, put it in a
journal entry, make it part of your
active language right away. Precisely.
That's how you make it stick. Okay. So,
natural learning, active use. What about
the input side? Listening and reading.
Huge emphasis on that, too. Learning
through stories is highlighted. Things
like podcasts for learners, little
stories for English learners was
mentioned. Or apps that help with
reading stories like Linkq or maybe
Beline Reader. Yes. tools like that. The
idea is the more you encounter a word or
a phrase in different sort of natural
contexts, the more just sinks in without
you having to force it. Exactly. Your
brain starts to just pick up the meaning
and usage naturally. And to help really
lock that learning in, the video
mentions spaced repetition, right?
Absolutely. This is where you bring in
tools like Anki or Quizlet or
Memorize. There are quite a few and they
basically schedule reviews for you.
Yeah, they prompt you to recall
information just um just around the time
you might be about to forget it. Smart.
So, it actively strengthens the memory,
right? It works with how your brain
actually learns and remembers things.
Makes the whole process much more
efficient. Okay. And alongside
listening, the video still gives a big
thumbs up to reading. Oh, definitely.
Reading is still described as incredibly
powerful, not just for vocab, for
grammar, too. How does that work? Well,
as you read more, you just keep seeing
the same grammar patterns, the same
sentence structures used correctly over
and over again. Ah, so your brain starts
to internalize those patterns. Exactly.
To develop that kind of gut feeling for
what sounds right in English, even if
you can't explain the specific grammar
rule behind it. And the video had a
specific technique for making reading
even better. A top three hack, I think
they called it. Yes. Pairing reading
with audiobooks. So reading the text
while listening to it being read. That's
the one.
follow along in the book or on the
screen while listening to a native
speaker read it. Why is that combo so
good? Well, it hits multiple things at
once. Pronunciation, obviously,
intonation, the rhythm of the language
and crucially for English, right? Where
spelling can be so tricky. It connects
the written word directly to how it
sounds. Very powerful. Builds confidence
for speaking too, I imagine. Definitely
helps you connect the visual and the
auditory. Okay, let's shift gears
slightly. What about when you do need to
work on grammar more directly or improve
your writing? Good question. The video
suggests using technology here, too.
Tools like Grammarly or Quillbot or
similar apps. How do they help? They act
like a sort of um instant feedback
mechanism. They check your writing, spot
potential errors in grammar or
structure, and suggest better ways to
say things. Exactly. They help you see
where you might be going wrong and guide
you towards more natural or correct
phrasing. It's like having a helpful
editor looking over your shoulder. The
video also mentioned something about fun
quick grammar practices, mini
challenges. Oh yeah, those little
interactive things you see sometimes on
Tik Tok or Instagram, like spot the
mistake or answer a quick question,
right? They're fast. They make you think
for just a second. And yeah, the source
called them kind of addictive. A good
kind of addictive hopefully. Hopefully,
it's just about getting these little
bursts of active engagement with the
language throughout your day. There was
another really interesting tip. Learning
in chunks. What's that about? Ah,
chunking. This is Well, it's a really
effective way to sound more fluent.
Instead of trying to piece sentences
together word by word using grammar
rules, you learn common phrases.
Exactly. You learn common phrases and
patterns that native speakers use all
the time as complete units or chunks.
like the examples can I get or I'm not
sure if or that depends on yeah those
kinds of things you learn the whole
phrase as one block and the grammar is
just sort of baked in it is when you
learn can I get you're learning the
correct structure for asking politely
without even thinking about you know
modal verbs or inversion it's functional
practical grammar very practical the
video even pointed to another resource a
clip broke down showing how much useful
language is packed into just a tiny any
bit of real conversation. And for
writing specifically, those tools like
Grammarly come back in. Yeah. The source
basically says, "Improving writing has
quote never been easier." Having an
editor in your pocket. That's the phrase
used. Instant feedback, vocabulary,
suggestions. It's a huge help for
building writing confidence. Okay, let's
talk speaking. This felt like a really
key section. The video calls now a
golden time for speaking practice. It
really does and it emphasizes this is
great for everyone, but maybe especially
helpful if you're a bit introverted or
shy about speaking. Why is it a golden
time? Well, obviously the traditional
routes are still there. Group lessons,
finding a private tutor, joining a
speaking club. The video mentioned a
friend's club, Dianiela, I think. Yes,
as a good example of a speaking club.
Those are still great options. But the
real gamecher is AI. It's the incredible
amount of AI tools, as the video puts
it. They've just exploded recently. Like
chat GPT's voice feature. Exactly. You
can literally have a spoken conversation
with Chat GPT now back and forth about
anything. Wow. And you can ask it to
correct you. Yeah. You can tell, hey,
can you correct my mistakes but like
naturally like a friend would and it can
do that. That removes a lot of pressure.
Totally. And then there are apps
specifically designed for this like
Eloise or Speak which simulate
conversations and just make practice
feel really easy. The person in the
video said this tech would have been
life-changing for them as an introverted
learner. Yeah, they call it mindblowing
even now. And you can see why. It just
lowers that barrier to actually starting
to speak so much. Practice anytime. No
judgment. What about getting the sounds
right? Pronunciation. Also, lots of
great tools. The video specifically
mentions Elsa Speak. Ah, yeah. They've
been around a while, right? A longtime
partner mentioned. and also an app from
Hadar Shamesh from Accents Way. And
these apps give you feedback on your
specific sounds. Yes, they use voice
recognition to analyze your
pronunciation and give you targeted
feedback to help you sound clearer, more
confident. So, lots of tech help, but
the video also brought back a classic
technique for speaking and
pronunciation. Shadowing. Still one of
the absolute best, but with a really
crucial tip at it. Yes, this was
important. Always use subtitles when you
shadow. Why is that so vital? Because
honestly, it's super easy to mishar
things when listening to natural fast
speech. You might think they said one
word, but it was another. Exactly. Or
you miss how words blend together. And
if you shadow based on misharing
something, you learn the mistake affects
your grammar, your pronunciation. Right.
Subtitles show you precisely what's
being said. They help you catch common
things like contractions going to
becoming going to or connected speech
like how did you can sound like did you
those kinds of things subtitles make it
clear. So the process is watch something
with English subtitles YouTube whatever.
Yep. Pause it. Repeat the sentence out
loud. Try to copy everything. The
rhythm, the tone, the connected sounds.
Don't overthink the grammar rules while
doing it. No. Just listen. Enjoy.
Imitate. Focus on those common phrases,
those chunks we talked about. The more
you do it, the more natural it starts to
feel. And for people ready to level up
their shadowing, the video suggests
recording yourself shadowing. Ooh, that
takes courage. It does. But then you
listen back and compare your recording
directly to the original speaker and you
can really hear the differences.
Exactly. It forces you to listen
critically to yourself and pinpoint what
needs work. That kind of analysis can
lead to huge improvements. Okay, moving
towards the cutting edge now. The video
talked about VR, virtual reality
learning. Yeah, this is where it gets
pretty futuristic, but it's actually
happening now. It's described like
stepping inside a video game or a movie.
You need a headset, like a MetaQuest or
Oculus, right? You need the VR headset
and then you're in this like 3D world
and you can practice English there. How?
Well, apps like Immerse or Mon mentioned
in the video. They put you in virtual
scenarios like a coffee shop or an
airport check-in desk or a classroom and
you interact. Yeah, you can walk around,
look around, and actually speak English
to do things. Order a virtual coffee,
talk to a virtual teacher, maybe
interact with other learners or AI
characters in that space. That sounds
intense, but also kind of fun. It's
described as makebelieve, but
surprisingly real. And because it's
virtual, it's a totally safe space to
practice those real world interactions.
Definitely something to check out if you
have the chance. Cool. And finally,
there were two bonus ideas thrown in.
Yep. First one, language exchange apps
like Tandem Hello Talk. Tandem Hello
Talk speaking apps like that. They
connect you directly with native English
speakers who might be learning your
language or just other learners for
actual conversation practice. Real
conversation. Yeah. And cultural
exchange, too. Great way to make
connections. And the second bonus idea,
creating an English second life.
Huh. Yeah, I like this one. It's about
carving out a space online where you
just use English, like a dedicated
Instagram account or Tik Tok could be or
YouTube shorts, whatever platform you
like. The idea is to commit to posting
content there only in English. What sort
of stuff? Anything really. Little voice
notes, video clips, talking at your day,
reviewing a product, having a mini rant,
just your normal interests, but
expressed in English. Making it part of
your creative outlet. Exactly. It makes
practice consistent, integrated, and
potentially really fun and rewarding.
Wow. Okay, that's a lot of ground we've
covered. From changing how we think
about grammar to using AI for speaking
practice, reading with audio, shadowing
effectively with subtitles, even VR, and
building an online English persona, it
really drives home the video's main
point, doesn't it? With all this tech
and these refined methods, 2025 really
is an amazing time to be learning
English. There's so much support
available. There really is loads of
options to suit different styles and
needs. So, thinking about everything
we've discussed, all these practical
tools and approaches, learning in
context, active use, space repetition,
reading plus audio, chunking, AI, chat,
shadowing, right, VR, maybe language
exchange, that second life idea. Which
one or maybe which combination feels
like something you listening might want
to try first? Yeah, it's worth
considering. How will you take advantage
of this well this golden time for
English learning? How can you weave some
of these ideas into your routine this
year to make learning feel more natural,
more integrated, and ultimately more
successful? Thanks for joining us here

Thanks again for listening to English
Phrases Hub. Happy learning and bye for
now.
Welcome everyone to English Phrases Hub.
I'm uh really happy you're joining us
today. Hi everyone. I am too and we're
really excited to, you know, spend this
time with you exploring how to
communicate a bit more confidently,
maybe more naturally on social media.
That's right. This is well, it's a
special deep dive for all of you
intermediate English learners out there.
People who want to connect online, maybe
with friends, family, new people, right?
but without feeling, you know, unsure
about what to say or or how exactly to
say it. Think of this as your um
friendly guide to online English. We've
looked at some common questions, some
challenges learners face, and we're
going to share some really practical
phrases and uh tips you can start using
like right away on Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, wherever you are online. Yeah.
Today we'll be focusing on well first
how to easily start conversations using
some simple but um really effective
phrases and we'll also look at some
common little mistakes things that are
easy to make you know and how to avoid
them. Good idea plus some ideas on
making your posts a bit more interesting
more engaging for others. And finally,
yeah, we'll touch on how to build a sort
of positive and friendly online presence
overall, right? Whether you're just
sharing updates or asking questions or,
you know, connecting,
these skills will really help you feel
more comfortable, I think, more
confident in your online English.
Absolutely. Social media is well, it's a
wonderful way to have fun, isn't it? And
learn new things, connect with people
globally. It really is. And with just a
few key phrases and maybe an awareness
of those common pitfalls, you can really
make the most of it. So, uh, shall we
take a closer look? Let's do it. You
know, when you think about it, the
internet, social media, it's given us
this incredible opportunity, hasn't it,
to share our thoughts, our ideas with a
well, a global audience almost tackly.
It's quite remarkable. It really is.
Through online communication, you can
connect with people from so many
different backgrounds, different
cultures. You might share just a simple
photo or a short message and someone
literally on the other side of the world
can see it and respond. And what's so
interesting is just how many people are
online now. The statistic is something
like nearly 2third of the world's
population uses social media. Wow.
That's a massive global community right
there at your fingertips. Exactly. And
because your words can potentially reach
so many people, it becomes really
important, doesn't it, to express
yourself clearly and also respectfully.
Yeah, definitely. Being able to
communicate well in English online can
really open doors. I think you might
find yourself making new friends,
understanding different viewpoints,
maybe even discovering new opportunities
you hadn't thought of before. And it's
worth remembering too that what you
share online, it often stays there for a
while, right? And can be seen by lots
and lots of people. That's true. So this
power to connect, it also comes with a
kind of responsibility to be thoughtful
in what we say. Yeah. You know, a kind
comment or a well-written post, it can
really make someone's day or spark a
great discussion. That's such a good
point. On the other hand, though,
messages that are unclear or maybe a bit
negative, they can sometimes lead to
misunderstandings, right? Which we want
to avoid. We definitely do. So, the main
idea here, I suppose, is that social
media really makes your voice travel
far. It's like having a um a microphone
that the whole world can potentially
hear. That's a great analogy. And with
the tips we're going to share today, our
aim is really just to help you make sure
your message, your voice is clear,
positive, and you know, helps you
connect genuinely with others. Okay. So,
now that we've thought about that big
picture, the impact of online
communication, let's zoom in a bit.
Let's look at some really practical ways
you can start getting involved. You
know, joining conversations online,
right? Because often that first step to
connecting is simply asking a question,
isn't it? Or inviting people to share
what they think. Using specific phrases,
phrases designed for engagement is a
fantastic way to show you're actually
interested in what other people think.
So, um, let's look at a few useful ones
you can easily use. Okay, sounds good.
The first phrase we want to share is,
"What are your thoughts on?" Ah, yes.
classic. It's a really polite, quite
direct way to ask someone what they
think about something. So, for example,
if you share maybe a news story or a
video you found interesting, yeah, you
could just add to your post, what are
your thoughts on this? It's very similar
to saying, "What do you think about
this?" But it it sounds quite engaging
and it shows you value their
perspective. Exactly. Another really
helpful one is, "I'm curious to hear."
Oo, I like that one. Yeah. It's great
for showing that you're genuinely
interested in learning about other
people's experiences or their ideas. So,
for instance, if you're posting about,
say, learning English online, you could
write, "I'm curious to hear about your
experiences with different online
learning platforms." Nice. It's
friendly. Encourages people to share
their stories. And notice that word
curious. It really emphasizes you
genuinely want to know. It does sound
really genuine. And here's another one
we think you'll find useful. I'd love to
know more about. Uh, that's a warm one.
It really is. It's very warm, very
encouraging. If someone mentions maybe a
new hobby they've started or a project
they're working on. Yeah. You could
reply to their post with something like,
"Oh, I'd love to know more about how you
got into photography." It shows your
enthusiasm. Definitely and encourages
them to share more details. It's a great
phrase for comments, I think, because it
makes people feel like their input is
valued, interesting to you. These are
all fantastic ways to, you know, get a
conversation going and maybe to help you
get comfortable using them, why not try
repeating them with us now? Good idea.
What are your thoughts on What are your
thoughts on I'm curious to hear? I'm
curious to hear. I'd love to know more
about I'd love to know more about See,
these kinds of questions, these
statements, they really invite people to
respond. They do. So, when you make your
own posts, maybe on Twitter or Facebook,
try ending with one of these. You could
say, "Share a bit about your day." and
then ask, "What are your thoughts on
having a relaxing
evening?" You might find people are much
more likely to reply because you've
directly asked for their input. And it's
also important to remember the um the
tone, isn't it? The way you say these
phrases matters. Your message should
sound polite, genuinely interested,
using words like curious, or that gentle
phrasing, I'd love to. It can make your
English sound even more friendly, more
natural, right? It helps others feel
comfortable joining in, maybe less shy
or hesitant. Exactly. Okay. So, now that
we've given you some useful phrases to
help you start connecting, let's maybe
talk about some things that can
sometimes cause little uh bumps in the
road, things you might want to be a bit
careful with on social media. That's
right. It's completely normal, isn't it,
to make little mistakes when you're
learning a language, especially online.
It's so fast-paced. Oh, absolutely. But
just being aware of some common things
that can lead to misunderstandings that
can really help you communicate more
smoothly. So, here are maybe three main
areas to keep in mind. Okay. The first
thing to be mindful of is overusing
emojis. Aha. Yes. The emoji dilemma.
Exactly. Now, emojis can definitely be
fun, right? A quick way to add emotion
or tone. Little smiley face shows you're
happy. Yeah. But using too many emojis
all at once sometimes it can be a bit
distracting or maybe even look a little
unprofessional depending on the context.
Yeah, I agree. For example, if you write
something like, "I'm so excited,"
followed by, you know, five or six
different party
emojis. Right? All those exclamation
marks and the emojis might actually feel
a bit overwhelming for the person
reading it. It's perfectly fine to use
one, maybe two well-chosen emojis to
show how you feel. Mhm. Moderation. But
yeah, try not to go overboard. Also,
it's interesting, isn't it, that not
everyone interprets every single emoji
in exactly the same way. That's true. So
too many can sometimes just be confusing
or maybe seem a bit silly, right? Okay.
Second common thing to watch out for,
misusing slang or abbreviations. Social
media is absolutely full of informal
word slang and shortened forms
abbreviations. Yeah, lol. OMG. Exactly.
You probably know common ones like LOL
for laugh out loud or omg for oh my god.
Now, while these can be useful,
sometimes funny. Yeah. Using them
incorrectly or maybe too often can
sometimes lead to confusion. That's a
really important point. Like saying LOL
in response to some really sad news.
That would seem very strange, wouldn't
it? Very odd. Yeah, because it suggests
you find it funny. Similarly, using a
slang word in the wrong context can just
make your message hard for others to
understand. So, what's the advice? Well,
if you're ever not completely sure about
a slang word or an abbreviation, it's
probably best to either just avoid using
it or, you know, take a quick moment to
look it up, see how it's normally used.
Good tip. And on a related note, it's
generally a good idea to avoid those
very casual text abbreviations like
writing U instead of U or R for R. Ah,
yeah. Text speak. Exactly. especially in
more public posts or when you're talking
to people you don't know very well.
Using those very short forms too much
can sometimes make your message seem a
bit too informal, maybe even lazy or
just be misunderstood by people who
aren't familiar with that style. Okay,
that makes sense. And the third thing to
pay attention to, right? Number three,
trying not to ignore grammar and
spelling. The basics. The basics. Yeah,
it's so easy to quickly type out a
message on social media without really
thinking about these things, but taking
just a moment to check your writing can
really make a big difference in how
clear your message is. Absolutely. Good
grammar, correct spelling, it just makes
your posts much easier for everyone to
read and understand. If you consistently
write something like say don't have time
instead of don't have time, it might
seem small, but it can actually make it
a little harder for people to follow
what you mean. Exactly. You certainly
don't need to be absolutely perfect.
Nobody expects that. But making an
effort with basic punctuation, commas,
periods, apostrophes, and quickly
checking your spelling, especially for
important posts, is a really good habit
to get into. And the wonderful thing is
most phones and computers have spell
checkers built right in, don't they?
They do. They can help you catch those
little errors. For example, mixing up
words like your and your or there and
there. Oh, classic ones. very common
mistakes even for native speakers. Just
paying a little bit of attention to
these kinds of details can really make
your English look more polished, more
professional online. So, the takeaway
here is don't worry if you've made these
little slips before. Most people have.
Absolutely. The key is just to become a
little more mindful, right, as you
communicate online. Try to use emojis
thoughtfully. Learn slang gradually. Use
it when it feels right. Right.
Appropriately. And always take a quick
look at what you've written before you
hit send or post. By being mindful of
these common areas, your online
communication will just become even
clearer and more effective. Definitely.
Okay, so we have some ideas about what
to maybe be a little careful of. Now,
let's think about how you can make your
social media posts really shine. Grab
people's attention in a good way. Yeah.
How to make your content more
interesting, more engaging for others.
This is where you can really let your
personality come through. I think
creating compelling content. It's all
about making your posts interesting,
clear, and something people actually
enjoy reading and maybe want to respond
to. Okay, so what are the tips? Well,
here are a few simple but I think
effective tips. First, try to use strong
action verbs whenever you can. Action
verbs. Verbs, you know, are the action
words and choosing verbs that are
powerful, descriptive. It really makes
your writing more lively, more engaging.
Can you give an example? Sure. So
instead of saying I got a new job, which
is fine. Yeah, it's okay. You could say
I landed at a new job. Landed sort of
paints a picture of success, doesn't it?
It feels more active. It does. Yeah. Or
if you saw a great movie instead of just
it was good. Maybe something like it
blew me away. That means you were really
impressed. Ah, okay. Much more impact.
Exactly. Strong verbs add energy, make
people more interested in what you're
sharing. Great tip. What's next? Second
really effective idea, include visuals
when you can, if it's appropriate.
Pictures and videos. Exactly. You know
the English saying, "A picture is worth
a thousand words." Mhm. On social media,
a good photo or a short interesting
video often grabs attention much faster
than just plain text. That's definitely
true. So, if you're sharing about, say,
a delicious meal you cooked, include a
nice photo. Makes me hungry just
thinking about it. Me, too. Or if you're
talking about a beautiful place you
visited, definitely add a picture of the
view. Right? If you're explaining how to
do something, maybe a simple craft or a
recipe, think about adding a short video
or an image of the finished thing.
Visuals really help tell your story.
Give your audience something to connect
with instantly. Plus, as we said, for
English learners, a good image can often
help explain what you mean without
needing quite so many words. That's a
really practical point. Okay. And the
third tip for compelling content, right?
Number three, aim to be concise and
clear in your writing. Keep it short and
sweet. Kind of. Yeah. People scrolling
through social media often do it quite
quickly, don't they? They do. Long,
complicated paragraphs. They can
sometimes just get skipped over. So, try
using shorter sentences or maybe break
up text with bullet points if that makes
sense for your post. Get to the main
point without too many extra unnecessary
words. Can you show us what you mean?
Maybe a long- winded versus concise
example. Sure. Okay. Imagine you wanted
to share about going to a market. Long-
winded might be. I wanted to share that
yesterday I went to the market which is
downtown and I bought some fresh
vegetables which was a really enjoyable
experience for me honestly. Okay. Lots
of ants and witches. Exactly. A more
concise version could be. Yesterday I
visited the downtown market and bought
fresh vegetables. It was a really
enjoyable experience. Ah much easier to
read, clearer, right? easier to read
quickly, especially on a small screen.
The sentences are clearer. Being concise
isn't about leaving out important stuff.
It's about choosing words carefully. So,
each word adds value, makes your message
easy to grasp, and more people are
likely to actually read it and
understand it quickly that way. That's
the goal. Okay. So, just to quickly
recap those tips for compelling content,
use strong action verbs, include visuals
when you can. Yeah. And aim for clear
and concise writing. Exactly. If you put
these ideas into practice, your posts
are likely to stand out more, attract
more positive attention, and people
often appreciate content that's well
written and visually appealing, don't
they? Especially when it comes from
someone sharing in their second
language. It shows effort. It really
does. It shows you've put thought into
your communication. Okay. Now, for our
final part today, let's talk about well
you and how you interact with others
online over time. This is about building
a positive, friendly online presence,
right? Yeah. Exactly. So that all your
communication habits together help you
really connect well with others on
social media in the long run. Because
building a strong online presence, it
isn't just about one single amazing
post, is it? No, not at all. It's about
creating a consistent positive
impression through all your interactions
online over time. So here are a few key
things to maybe focus on. Okay, what's
the first one? First, try to be prompt
and responsive promptly. Just means, you
know, quickly within a reasonable amount
of time, right? Don't leave people
hanging. Exactly. Yeah. If someone
leaves a comment on your post or sends
you a direct message, try to reply when
you can, maybe within a day or so if
possible. For example, if you ask, "What
are your thoughts on a Naka?" and
someone takes the time to answer. Make
sure you acknowledge it. Yeah,
definitely. Even a simple thanks for
sharing or thanks for your thoughts or
maybe a direct answer to their point. It
makes a big difference. So why is being
prompt so important? Well, responding in
a timely way shows you're present,
you're engaged in the conversation. It
shows you value their input and it
encourages them to keep interacting with
you in the future. Builds that
connection. Okay, that makes sense.
What's the next element? Another really
important one is to try to stay positive
and respectful in your interactions.
Positivity online. Yeah, it could be
really powerful. It doesn't mean you
have to be like super cheerful all the
time. No, not fake. Well, not fake. No,
but aiming for a generally respectful,
positive tone in your posts and replies.
That's a good goal. And what if you
disagree with someone? That's a great
question. If you disagree, try to share
your perspective politely. without being
negative or attacking their opinion
personally. How would you phrase that?
You could say something like, "That's an
interesting point. I see it a little
differently
because or I understand where you're
coming from, but in my experience,
something like that. It keeps the
conversation friendly, constructive.
Okay. Also, generally try to share
things you find interesting, enjoyable,
or maybe inspiring. Positivity tends to
attract people, makes the online space
more pleasant for everyone involved. And
what about negative comments directed at
you? Sometimes that happens.
Unfortunately, yes. If you do come
across negative or unkind comments,
often the best approach is either to
respond very calmly, factually, or maybe
even just not to engage with them at
all. Don't get drawn into an argument.
Right. Protect your peace. Exactly. It
helps you maintain your own positive
reputation. Just remember, your online
presence grows with every single
interaction. So, always try to keep it
kind and respectful. Good advice. Okay.
And the final element for a strong
online presence. And finally, and this
is perhaps the most important one, try
to share your own voice and be
authentic. Be yourself. Be yourself.
Exactly. Sharing your voice just means
letting your true personality, your
interests shine through in your
communication online. Being authentic,
being genuine, helps you connect with
others in a much more meaningful way.
So, don't be afraid to post about things
you're actually interested in. Not at
all. share your experiences, maybe talk
about things you're learning or working
on as long as it feels right for you and
the platform, of course. Maybe you love
photography or you care deeply about a
cause. Share that. And it doesn't matter
if the English isn't perfect. Absolutely
not. When you're writing in English,
it's perfectly okay if it's not
grammatically perfect all the time. What
really matters is that it's genuinely
you. People connect much more with
individuals they feel are being real.
That's reassuring. So instead of just,
you know, copying popular posts or
trying to say what you think others want
to hear, try to share your own unique
perspective. Like maybe talking about
using a new English phrase you learned.
Exactly. That's a perfect example. Your
journey as an English learner and just
as a person is interesting. By sharing
your authentic self, you build a
presence that's unique to you and that
can attract friends or followers who
genuinely connect with who you are.
Okay, so let's quickly summarize.
Building that strong online presence,
aim to respond promptly. Maintain a
positive and respectful tone, right? And
always let your true personality, your
authentic voice shine through. That's
it. Over time, these consistent habits
will show others that you're a
thoughtful, engaging person to connect
with online. Oh, wow. We've covered so
much ground in this deep dive today. We
really have. We talked about how
important online communication is.

get conversations started, highlighted
some common mistakes to be aware of,
gave ideas for creating more interesting
content, and just now talked about
building that positive online presence.
That's right. We explored the power of
connecting online, why clear and
positive communication is so valuable.
We learned those essential engagement
phrases like, "What are your thoughts
on?" I'm curious to hear and I'd love to
know more about. We also talked about
avoiding those little mistakes, too many
emojis, misusing slang, not checking
grammar, right? Then making posts more
interesting with strong verbs, visuals,
and keeping it concise. And finally,
building that presence, being
responsive, staying positive, and being
authentic. We really hope that all these
tips have been helpful for you and that
they'll give you maybe a bit more
confidence in your online English
communication. Yeah, social media is

isn't it? And with these skills, we hope

skill, the more you practice, the easier
it gets, more natural it becomes. So
true. So why not try it? Maybe use one
of the new phrases or focus on one of
the tips we shared next time you post
something or leave a comment. Yeah, give
it a go. You might be pleasantly
surprised by how it feels and maybe how
people respond, too. Thank you so much

Welcome to the English Phrases Hub
podcast, where you learn real useful
English, one phrase at a time. Today
we're uh tackling something really
important, especially if you're learning
English. We are we're looking at how to
communicate in emergencies and
accidents. You know, using English
effectively when things go wrong.
Exactly. Think of this as well building
your confidence, giving you the simple,
clear language you need for those tough
situations. And we've really focused on
finding phrases that are, you know, easy
to pick up, but also super practical for
lots of different critical moments.
Yeah. And just to let you know, we'll be
speaking clearly, maybe a little slower
than usual, just to help you catch
everything and build that vocabulary.
Absolutely. We want this to be really
useful for you. So, what are we
covering? Well, everything from asking
for help right at the start to calling
emergency services, dealing with medical
crisis, uh, car accidents, fires,
natural disasters, even talking to
doctors or the police afterwards. It's a
full toolkit really. That's the mission
today. Yeah. Equip you with those
essential English phrases. And
importantly, we've put together a free
resource for you, something you can
download. Oh, great. What's in that?
It's got all the phrases we're going to
talk about, examples, definitions, even
a practice exercise. Just check the link
in the episode description. It should be
a really helpful reference. Fantastic.
Okay, let's get straight to it then.
First up, asking for help. This seems
like the most basic crucial starting
point. It really is. Being able to just
signal clearly that you need help is
fundamental, especially when you know
you might be stressed, maybe traveling,
feeling anxious. Yeah. Your mind goes
blank sometimes. Exactly. So, these
phrases are your direct line to getting
support. So, what's the most direct one?
Well, probably the simplest and most
urgent is just help me please. Right.
Direct. Gets the point across. And the
please keeps it polite, which actually
helps, doesn't it? It often does. Yeah.
So, you might shout, "Uh, help me
please. My friend is hurt." Okay. What
else? Close behind that is, "I need
help." Yeah. It's It's still very clear
you need assistance. serious situation.
Maybe slightly less immediate panic than
help me please. Okay. So, like maybe if
you lost something important. Yeah,
exactly. Like, I need help. I lost my
phone and wallet. Still serious, but
maybe not life or death immediate.
Gotcha. And what if it's less urgent,
but you still need assistance? Then
something a bit softer or more polite.
Can you help me? This is great for well,
more general requests, like finding your
way. Perfect example. Excuse me, can you
help me? I can't find my hotel. simple
polite request. Okay. But then there are
medical emergencies that needs something
specific. Absolutely. Time is critical
there. So the key phrase is please call
an ambulance. Direct instruction leaves
no doubt. Exactly. She's not moving.
Please call an ambulance. And uh just a
quick side note here, remember those
emergency numbers, right? 911 in the
US.12 in Europe. Yeah. Yeah. It's really
worth checking the local number wherever
you travel. Super important. Good tip.
Okay. What if you you just feel
something's wrong, but you're not sure
what. Ah, yes, that happens. A simple
something's wrong works really well
there. It alerts people like something's
wrong. I think she's about to faint.
Precisely. It flags that there might be
an issue developing. And finally, to
really ramp up the urgency. It's an
emergency. Yeah. Short, direct, leaves
absolutely no doubt it's serious and
needs immediate attention. Like, it's an
emergency. He's having chest pain.
Exactly. The directness conveys the
gravity. No messing around. Okay, let's
quickly recap some key words there. We
said emergency,
which is, you know, a serious danger
situation needing fast action. The
ambulance, the vehicle that takes people
to hospital and faint. That's when
someone loses consciousness suddenly
just for a bit, right? And the main
takeaway here, keep it simple. Focus on
being understood. Don't worry about
perfect grammar in that moment. Clarity
is king. Your tone and, you know, body
language help too, I guess. Definitely.
They add a lot of context. Okay, ready
for the next step? Yep. Let's talk about
actually calling emergency services
yourself, right? Sometimes you'll need
to make that call directly. Police,
fire, ambulance, or tell someone else to
do it. Can feel a bit daunting. I
imagine it can, but again, simple is
best. You don't need long, complex
sentences. Just clear, brief phrases.
So, what's the go-to phrase if someone's
hurt or very sick? I need an
ambulance. Straightforward. You'd use it
for serious illness or injury. Maybe add
why. Like, I need an ambulance. My
brother fell and hit his head. Exactly.
That extra bit of info is really helpful
context for the operator. And if you
need someone else to call, then you
shout call 911 if you're in the US. Or
more generally, call the emergency
number if you're not sure of the local
code. So, call 911. There's been an
accident. or call the emergency number
if someone's unconscious. Urgent
commands. Okay, so you get through. What
do you say first? A good way to start is
there's been an accident. It immediately
tells them something serious has
happened. Then maybe add details.
There's been an accident on Main Street.
A car hit a bicycle. We need help.
Perfect. A brief overview helps them
understand the situation quickly. Is
there a more maybe formal way to ask for
medical help specifically? Yes, you
could say, "We need medical assistance.
It clearly states you need help from
medical professionals like we need
medical assistance. A woman has
collapsed in the lobby. Exactly. It
emphasizes the need for medical
expertise.
Now, probably the most vital bit of
information. Location, location,
location. Absolutely. How do you phrase
that simply? Just we're at location. No,
be as specific as possible. We're at the
corner of Elm Street and 4th Avenue or
we're in Central Park near the fountain.
Even there's a fire. We're at 18 Greenh
Hill Road. Please come quickly. The more
detailed, the faster they find you.
Okay. Key vocab again. Ambulance. We
know medical assistance. Help from
doctors, paramedics, nurses, trained
medical people, and emergency number.
The specific phone number for those
services in that area. So, tips for
making that call. Try to stay calm. I
know it's hard, but try. Speak slowly,
clearly. Say what happened, what help
you need, and exactly where you are. And
don't stress about perfect English.
Absolutely not. The operators are
trained and understand and get the info
they need even with basic English.
They're there to help you. Okay, good.
Now, let's zoom in on medical
emergencies themselves, describing
what's actually happening, right? These
things can happen fast and explaining
the problem clearly is crucial for
getting the right help. Let's start with
something really serious. What if
someone isn't breathing? The critical
phrase is he's not breathing or she's
not breathing. Use this as someone's
unconscious and you can't see or feel
any breath. He's not breathing. We need
help now. Very clear. Very clear. Very
urgent. Now, what if someone just
suddenly passes out for a moment? That's
fainting, right? Exactly. So, you'd say,
"He fainted." Or, "She fainted."
Remember, faint is that brief loss of
consciousness, maybe from heat or low
blood sugar. So, you might say, "She
fainted while waiting in line. Can you
get some water?" Perfect example.
Explains what happened and suggests a
simple action. What if you don't know
why they're unwell, but they're clearly
in distress? If pain is obvious, you can
say he's in pain, or she's in pain. This
tells people the person is conscious,
but suffering. Like, he's in pain and
holding his stomach. I think it's
serious. Yes, that gives important
context, indicates it might be more than
just a minor ache. And that general
feeling again, when something just seems
off, back to something's not right. It's
really useful when you can't pinpoint
the issue, but you know intervention
might be needed. Something's not right.
She can't speak clearly and looks very
pale. Exactly. And pale, just to
clarify, means their skin looks
unusually white. Often a sign of illness
or shock. Okay. And if you can see a
specific serious symptom, be specific,
like he's having chest pain or she's
having trouble breathing. These sound
really important for things like heart
attacks or asthma. They are he's having
chest pain. I think it might be a heart
attack or she's having trouble
breathing. Do you have an inhaler? And
definitions again. Chest pain is
discomfort or actual pain in the chest
area. Trouble breathing. Difficulty
getting air in and out of the lungs.
Gasping maybe. Okay, so recap vocab.
Fainted. Briefly unconscious. Chest
pain. Discomfort in the chest. Trouble
breathing. Difficulty getting air and
pale. Unusually white skin. And the
overall advice in a medical situation,
stay calm if you can. Keep the person
safe and comfortable. Use short, clear
phrases. Don't leave them alone if
possible. And again, clarity over
perfection. You got it. Clear
communication is the goal, right? Let's
shift gears now. Car accidents. How do
we talk about those? Okay. Yeah. Whether
you're involved or just see one, knowing
what to say is really helpful. People
are often stressed, maybe confused,
understandably. So, having a few simple
phrases helps you manage the situation,
get help, explain things. So, what's the
first thing you might say? To alert
someone or call services. Again,
starting simply, there's been an
accident. Immediately flags a serious
event. There's been an accident at the
traffic light. Two cars crashed.
Perfect. An accident, remember, is just
an unexpected event causing damage or
injury. Okay, next prior. Checking for
injuries. Always ask, "Is anyone hurt?"
shows concern, helps assess the
seriousness. Is anyone hurt? Should I
call an ambulance? Exactly. And hurt
just means injured, feeling pain. If
someone is hurt and it looks bad, then
you might need to state clearly, "We
need medical assistance." We've used
that one before. Reinforces the need for
medical help. Use it when calling 911 or
maybe telling police at the scene. Yes,
we need medical assistance. The driver
looks unconscious. Very clear. Accidents
can be chaotic. How do you help manage
that? Trying to keep things calm is key.
Using the phrase, "Please stay calm,"
can help others and maybe even yourself.
Please stay calm. Help is on the way.
Reassuring it can be. Now, if luckily no
one's hurt, but the cars are damaged.
You need to exchange details, right?
Insurance stuff. Correct. A polite way
to ask is, "Can I see your insurance
information?" "Can I see your insurance
information? I'll give you mine as
well." Fair exchange. Yep. And insurance
is that financial protection you have
for accidents. Okay, quick recap for
accidents. Accident, unexpected event,
damage or injury, hurt, injured, in
pain, medical assistance, need for
medical professionals. We've covered
that. And insurance, financial
protection for accidents. So, top tips
for handling a car accident situation.
Stay calm. Check for injuries first.
Call for help if needed. Take photos if
you can. Exchange info. And communicate
using those short, clear phrases. Good
advice. Okay, moving on to potentially
even more chaotic situations. Fires or
natural disasters, right? These can
escalate incredibly quickly. Clear
virgin communication is paramount for
safety. Yours and others. So, what are
the absolute must know phrases here?
Things you might need to shout. The most
obvious is there's a fire gets immediate
attention. There's a fire in the
kitchen. Get out now. Hard to ignore
that. Exactly. And fire uncontrolled
flames burning. After alerting people,
what's the next command? Getting
everyone out. Everyone get out. Short,
strong, essential command. Everyone get
out. The fire alarm is going off. Clear
instruction. And evacuate is the more
formal word for leaving a dangerous
place quickly. What if there's smoke or
the building seems unstable? You need to
warn people it's not safe is a clear
danger warning. Don't go back in. It's
not safe. Makes sense. And dangerous
just means it can cause harm. Smoke is
that dark cloud from the fire. I've
heard you should stay low in smoke. Yes.
Often the air is clearer near the floor.
So you might guide people by saying,
"Stay low and follow me." "Stay low and
follow me. I know the way to the
emergency exit." That could be
life-saving. Absolutely. And finally,
checking on others. Simple questions
like, "Are you okay?" Exactly. Or, "Do
you need help?" Showing concern,
offering assistance. Are you okay? Do
you need help getting out of the
building? Okay. Vocab review. Fire.
Uncontrolled burning. Evacuate. Leave
for safety. Crisis from fire and
dangerous can cause harm. Key advice for
these big emergencies, try to stay calm.
Easier said than done, I know. Use loud,
clear phrases. Move quickly. Help others
if you can safely do so. And know your
exits. Even those short phrases can make
all the difference. Huge difference.
Okay. So, after the immediate crisis,
you might need to talk to medical staff.
Let's cover that, right? Talking to
doctors, nurses, paramedics. Clear info
is vital for them to help properly.
They'll need to know what happened,
symptoms, maybe medical history. So,
let's look at useful phrases. What if
the person hasn't woken up, still
unconscious? You'd say, "She is
unconscious." Meaning, they're not
awake, not responding. "She is
unconscious. She hasn't moved in a few
minutes." Gives a time frame, too. Good
point. Now, what if they are awake but
clearly unwell, feeling strange, like
dizzy or weak. Exactly. You can say he
she feels dizzy. or he she feels weak.
Dizzy meaning like the room is spinning.
Yeah. Feeling unsteady like you might
fall. And weak is just lacking physical
strength. So he feels dizzy and can't
walk straight or she feels weak and
needs to lie down. Perfect descriptions.
Now medical history is often important.
How do you bring that up? You can say he
has a medical condition. This covers
things like diabetes, heart problems,
allergies. She has a heart condition.
She takes medicine for it. Links it to
medication, too. Good connection. And
mentioning specific medication is also
key. Say he she takes medicine name.
Even if you don't know the name, just
saying they take regular medication
helps. Absolutely. He takes insulin for
diabetes or even just she takes blood
pressure pills. Medication is just
another word for medicine. And if you
want to know what the plan is, what
happens next? A simple polite question.
What's going to happen next? What's
going to happen next? Will she need
surgery? Shows you're engaged and need
information. Precisely. Okay. Vocab
recap for medical staff talk.
Unconscious, not awake, unresponsive,
dizzy, feeling of spinning,
unsteadiness, medical condition, a known
health problem, and medication, medicine
taken regularly. Tips for this
conversation. Speak slowly, clearly. Use
simple words for symptoms. Don't worry
about fancy medical jargon. If you have
written info about conditions or meds,
especially when traveling, bring it. And
remember, they're trained to help even
with language barriers. Exactly. They
want to understand you. Okay. One last
area. Speaking to the police, right?
This might happen after accidents,
theft, or other incidents can be
intimidating, especially in a second
language. So, clear calm communication
is key. Again, always. Let's look at
some phrases to explain things. Ask for
help or answer basic questions. How do
you start? How do you tell them why you
need them? You can say, "I need to
report an incident." An incident is just
any serious or unusual event. I need to
report an incident. Someone broke into
my car. Clear purpose. And report means
to officially tell them. Correct. Now,
if it was, say, a car crash, they'll
want details. How do you describe it
simply? There was an accident on
location. Brief description, specific
place. There was an accident on King
Street near the bank. Gives them
context. We already covered accident. We
did. They might also ask if you saw it
happen. Were you a witness? How do you
answer that? Simply, I saw everything.
Or, I didn't see what happened. I saw
everything. The car went through the red
light. Or, I'm sorry, I didn't see what
happened. I just heard a crash. And a
witness is someone who sees something
happen. Exactly. Now, what if you don't
understand them? It's okay to ask for
clarification, right? Absolutely. Say,
"Can you repeat that, please?" Or
simply, "I don't understand." You can
even ask them to speak more slowly. Can
you repeat that please? My English isn't
perfect. That's perfectly fine to say.
Totally fine. And finally, knowing if
you can leave the scene. How do you ask
that politely? Am I allowed to leave or
do I need to stay here? Shows
cooperation while checking your status.
Do I need to stay here or can I go now?
Clear question. And allowed means having
permission. Correct. Okay. Final vocab
check for police interactions. report,
officially tells someone something,
incident, a serious or unusual event,
witness, someone who saw something
happen and allowed having permission.
So, general advice for talking to
police, stay calm, be polite, speak
slowly and clearly. Ask questions if
you're unsure, and always be truthful.
Remember, they are there to help. Okay,
that covers a lot of ground. Feels like
we've built a solid toolkit. I hope so.
And now maybe it's time for you, the
listener, to try putting it into
practice. Ah, yes, the challenge and
practice prompt. Okay, here it is.
Imagine one of these scenarios happens.
Maybe someone faints near you, or you
witness a car accident, or you smell
smoke and need to call about a fire, or
maybe you need to talk to a police
officer after an incident. Just pick
one. Yeah. And then try saying three to
five of the phrases we've discussed
today out loud. Think about what would
be most useful in that specific
situation. For instance, if someone
fainted, you might say, "Help me,
please. She fainted. Can you get some
water? Is she okay?" Something like
that. Or for the fire. There's a fire.
Call the emergency number. Everyone, get
out. We're at a dress. So, feel free to
pause the recording right now. Say your
phrases out loud. You could even write
them down first or record yourself on
your phone and listen back. It's a great
way to build confidence. Practicing
actually saying the words makes a big
difference. It really does. Look,
emergencies are scary. No doubt about
it. But being prepared with even a few
simple English phrases can make a huge
difference. It really can change how you
respond, how effectively you can get or
give help. And remember what we kept
saying, don't aim for perfection. Aim
for clarity. Be confident in getting
your basic message across. Absolutely.

Goodbye for now.
How many times have you stopped yourself
right before speaking? You had something
to say. You knew what you wanted to
express. The sentence was there, sitting
just behind your lips, but your voice
stayed quiet. Maybe you were afraid.
Afraid of getting it wrong, afraid
someone might laugh, afraid your accent
would show, afraid your words would come
out broken. So instead of speaking, you
smiled. You nodded. You said nothing.
And the moment passed. We've all been
there. That quiet pause where your
courage and your fear wrestle in silence
and fear wins. But here's what no one
tells you. The sentence you never said
could have been the beginning of your
fluency. Because fluency doesn't start
with perfection. It starts with trying.
Even when your voice shakes, even when
the grammar is wrong, even when it
sounds messy. Every fluent speaker once
whispered their first sentence, too. And
it probably wasn't perfect. It probably
wasn't even smooth. But they spoke and
then they spoke again and slowly their
voice found rhythm. Their fear softened
and their confidence began to grow. What
if the only thing standing between you
and the version of you who speaks with
confidence is one small moment of
courage? The moment you choose to say
something, even if it's not perfect, you
don't need perfect words. You need brave
ones. So the next time you feel the
sentence rising in your chest, let it
come out. Even if it's slow, even if
it's unsure, even if you have to pause
in the middle to find the word. Because
that's how it starts. One imperfect
sentence spoken anyway and then another
and another until one day you say it
easily and you barely remember the
fear. Let's take a breath and say it
anyway. You've got this and your voice
is ready.
People often say, "I just don't have
time." And maybe you've said it, too. I
want to practice my English, but I'm too
busy. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next week
when life slows down. But what if I told
you that 5 minutes could begin to change
everything? Not an hour, not a full
lesson, just five quiet minutes. 5
minutes to listen to an English podcast.
5 minutes to repeat a few simple
phrases. Five minutes to write one short
sentence in a notebook. That's it. No
pressure, no perfect plan, just
presence. Because here's something
important. You don't build fluency in a
day. You build it in the days you choose
not to give up. 5 minutes may not seem
like much, but 5 minutes done daily
becomes a rhythm. And rhythm becomes
routine. And routine becomes progress.
Even on the days you feel tired, even
when you feel stuck, 5 minutes is still
something. And something is always
better than nothing. Maybe you do it
while you're making your coffee or right
before bed or during your bus ride to
work. You don't need more time. You just
need to give a small part of your day to
the future version of you who speaks
clearly, confidently, and freely. The
difference between someone who learns
and someone who waits is often just 5
minutes.
So instead of asking yourself, do I have
time to practice today? Ask, can I give
myself just 5 minutes? Because 5 minutes
is enough to begin. And every beginning
opens a door. You don't have to do it
all. You just have to start. And 5
minutes is a beautiful place to
start. Sometimes you think you're not
improving. You listen to someone speak
fluently and wonder, "Why can't I speak
like that yet?" You study, you try, you
make mistakes, and still it feels like
you're not moving forward. But what if I
told you that growth is happening even
when you can't see it? Progress is often
invisible until one day it isn't. Think
about it. The first time you understood
a new word, the first time you finished
a full sentence, the first time you read
something without translating every word
in your head. You may not remember those
moments, but they were real. They
mattered and they built something. Just
like plants grow beneath the surface
before we ever see the leaves, your
language skills are growing quietly in
ways you don't always notice. You're
remembering more than you think. You're
understanding more than you realize.
You're building confidence even on the
days that feel small. We often expect
learning to be obvious, to feel like a
victory every day. But real progress,
it's quiet. It's slow. It's hidden until
it blooms. The days you doubt yourself
are often the days you're growing the
most. So if today feels slow, if your
practice feels messy, if your voice
feels unsure, keep going because
something inside you is learning to
believe again. Something inside you is
learning to stay. You don't need a sign.
You don't need a perfect result. You
just need to trust that every small
effort, every word spoken, every
sentence read is building something that
will last. You may not see it yet, but
you're becoming someone who doesn't give
up. And that is real
progress. You're waiting to feel ready.
You tell yourself, "Maybe tomorrow I'll
speak. Maybe when my grammar is better.
Maybe when I know the perfect word.
Maybe when I feel more confident." But
what if that moment never comes? What if
confidence doesn't come before you
speak, but
after? You don't speak because you're
ready. You speak so that one day you
will be. Fluent speakers weren't born
brave. They weren't born fluent. They
just started speaking before they felt
ready. They stumbled. They hesitated.
They forgot words. They laughed at their
own mistakes and they kept going. That's
what makes the difference. Not
perfection, not vocabulary size, not a
flawless accent, but the courage to open
your mouth even when it shakes. The
moment you speak imperfectly is the
moment your journey truly begins. So if
you're waiting to sound like a native
speaker, you'll wait forever. Instead,
speak now. Speak while you're still
unsure. Speak with the words you know
and let the rest come later. It doesn't
have to be a big sentence. It doesn't
have to be clever or complex. Even
something as simple as, "Hello, how are
you? Can I help you? I'm learning
English." That's enough. Each time you
speak, you tell your brain, "It's okay.
I can do this." Each time you speak, you
build a new connection between thought
and voice, between fear and action,
between learning and living. Your voice
is not waiting to be perfect. It's
waiting to be used. So speak. Speak
before you're ready. Speak softly. Speak
slowly, but speak. Because the moment
you do, you become the version of
yourself you've been waiting
for. There will be days you don't
practice. Days you forget. Days you
don't feel like it. Days when everything
feels heavy and learning English is the
last thing on your mind. You'll skip a
lesson. You'll stay quiet when you
wanted to speak. You'll make a mistake
and feel embarrassed. And that little
voice in your head might say, "I messed
up. I'm not serious. Maybe I should just
stop. But here's something I want you to
remember. You're allowed to start
again. No matter how many times you've
paused, no matter how long it's been,
you can always return. You can always
come back to your goals. You can always
pick up where you left off. You can
begin again slowly, gently, without
shame. Because this isn't a race. It's
not about being perfect. It's about
building a relationship with your
growth. And like all relationships, it
takes patience, kindness, and time.
Every time you come back, you're not
starting from zero. You're starting from
experience, from memory, from strength
you didn't even know you had. Progress
isn't ruined when you rest. It's only
paused, and you can press play again.
So, if you're listening to this now and
you've been feeling behind, unmotivated,
or ashamed for stopping, let that go.
Take a breath and let this be your
gentle invitation to begin again. No
pressure, no big plan, just one
sentence, one minute, one step. Because
the moment you return to your practice,
you are already on the path again. And
that's something to be proud of. So take
today, take this moment and say to
yourself, I'm not giving up. I'm just
starting again.

Subscribe to the channel and let's keep
learning together the calm, simple, and
powerful way. One phrase at a time.
It's from the English phrases hub and
it's called win any business discussion
with these smart English phrases. Okay.
Win might sound a little intense maybe.
Yeah, maybe a bit strong but think of it
more like um equipping yourself. Yeah.
Getting the right language tools for,
you know, better professional
communication in English. More
effective, more confident. Gotcha. So,
it's about tools, not battles. Exactly.
Our mission here is to pull out the
really practical English phrases for
this video. stuff you can use like
straight away to handle those tricky
workplace chats and just feel a bit more
in control. And what's interesting about
this video, I think, is how direct it
is. It's not uh getting lost in theory.
It's handing you these specific English
language tools, actual phrases you can
use to sort of gently guide discussions.
Okay, let's unpack the first one then.
This is for when you know he you send
someone's getting really frustrated. The
phrase is, "I understand your
frustration and I'll do my best to
resolve this issue." Simple but
effective. It seems simple. Yeah. But
what's the real power behind that
specific phrasing in English? Well, the
key is that immediate validation.
Someone's upset, right? The first thing,
often the most important, is just
acknowledging how they feel. Starting
with I understand your frustration does
exactly that. It's just like a
linguistic empathy. it can really
diffuse tension straight off. Yeah. And
the second part, I'll do my best right
to resolve this issue. That signals
you're actually going to do something.
You're committed to helping. So the
combo, it makes the other person feel
heard, feel valued. Shifts things from
conflict to uh collaboration. The video
had a good example. Customer says, "I've
been waiting over an hour. This delay is
really frustrating." Okay. Yeah. Classic
scenario. And the response is, "I
understand your frustration and I'll do
my best to resolve this issue. Let me
check what happened and find a solution
right away." It's like you're dealing
with the emotion first in English before
even tackling the problem. Precisely.
You avoid sounding defensive and you
immediately pivot towards solutions.
That's just vital for keeping
relationships positive, whether it's
clients or, you know, colleagues. Builds
trust. Definitely that proactive
language use is key. Okay. What about
feedback? Constructive criticism. Maybe
the video suggests, "Thank you for your
honesty. I'll work on improving this."
Let's look at why that works better in
English than say getting defensive.
Well, it shows maturity, doesn't it? And
like a growth mindset. Thank you for
your honesty. That acknowledges it takes
guts sometimes to give tricky feedback.
True. It says you value their input.
Even if it stings a bit, then I'll work
on improving this shows you're taking
responsibility. You're committed to
getting better. It just leaves a much
better impression than someone arguing
back. The example they used was,
"Feedback comes in. The project design
has some flaws. It's not quite meeting
our standards." Ouch. And the response,
"Thank you for your honesty. I'll work
on improving this. Could you share any
specific changes you'd like to see?"
That last bit's important, too, isn't
it? In English communication, asking for
more. Oh, absolutely. It turns something
potentially negative into a chance to
learn, to get on the same page. By
asking for specifics, you show you're
genuinely trying to fix the real issues.
Makes sense. Okay, moving to a phrase
about preventing future issues. Could
you share suggestions to avoid repeating
this situation? I like this one. It
shifts away from blame. Exactly. Instead
of getting stuck on what went wrong or
who messed up, this question points
straight towards fixing it for the
future. Proactive problem solving and
asking for suggestions involves others,
right? It empowers them, makes it a team
effort to improve the process, creates
that shared ownership. The videos
example, someone says, we had a lot of
confusion with the deadlines last week.
The response, I'm sorry about that.
Could you share suggestions to avoid
repeating this situation? I'd like to
make the process smoother next time.
It's just very forward-looking, clearly
put in English. Precisely. Shows you're
not just patching the hole. you're
thinking about uh building a better
system overall. Okay. Now, for times
when well, you messed up. The video
recommends, "I apologize for the
inconvenience. Let me fix this right
away." A real classic English phrase,
this one. It is, and for good reason.
It's direct, shows accountability, the
apology acknowledges the impact on the
other person, but crucially, it's
followed immediately by action. Let me
fix this right away. Shows ownership,
urgency. It's about saying sorry and
fixing it. Example time. The file you
sent is missing important data and I
needed it yesterday. Oh dear. Yep.
Happens. Response. I apologize for the
inconvenience. Let me fix this right
away. I'll send the corrected file in
the next 15 minutes. That specific time
frame in the next 15 minutes. That adds
something, doesn't it? In English
communication. It really does. It's not
just a vague promise. It sets a clear
expectation that can massively reduce
their frustration. and uh build
confidence that you'll actually follow
through. Okay, here's one about the
value of feedback itself. Mhm. We value
your feedback. It helps us grow. This
seems pretty fundamental for good
relationships in English professionally.
Absolutely. Whether it's customers or
colleagues saying this makes people feel
heard, feel appreciated. It signals
their opinions aren't just, you know,
tolerated, but actively wanted, used for
improvement. Leads to better input
later. Yeah, I think so. stronger
engagement, more constructive comments
down the line. The example was feedback
like I like your service overall, but
your website could be more userfriendly.
Common feedback and the response, we
value your feedback. It helps us grow.
I'll pass your comments on to our web
design team to make improvements. It
connects the feedback to potential
action. That link is important in
English communication. Exactly. It's not
just hot air. It suggests feedback is
taken seriously that it might actually
lead to real changes. Right now,
shifting gears a bit into negotiation
tactics. The phrase is, "What terms do
you consider fair for both sides?" That
feels well collaborative for starting a
negotiation in English. It really is.
Instead of leading with your own
demands, you invite their perspective
first. That sets a collaborative tone
right away. Shows you're interested in a
mutual solution. Exactly. Not just
pushing your own agenda. It signals you
want something that works for everyone.
Example, you say, "We need a higher
budget if we're going to meet your
timeline." Okay. Common sticking point.
Then you ask, "I understand. What terms
do you consider fair for both sides?
Let's discuss and see where we can meet
in the middle. Really opens up the
conversation in English." Totally. It
helps you understand their priorities,
their constraints first. That's gold for
finding creative solutions that actually
work for everyone. Leads to better
deals. I think building on that, the
next phrase, let's find a solution that
satisfies all parties without drastic
compromises. This really doubles down on
that win-win idea using clear English.
Yeah, it explicitly states the goal, a
balanced outcome, reassures everyone
you're not looking for someone to like
give up everything. Fosters trust. It
