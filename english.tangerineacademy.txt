Hey everyone, welcome back to Tangerine
Academy. Today we have a very
interesting question for you.
What could you do if you had $1 million?
Could you buy a house, travel the world,
help others?
Let's go find out what our students and
teachers say. But remember, speak in
English. This is your chance to dream
and practice.
Hi, Miguel. Quick question for you. If
you had $1 million today,
what would you do with it?
Oh man, that's a hard question. But,
okay, let me think.
If I had $1 million,
first I wouldn't spend it all at once.
I could be smart.
I think the first thing I would do is
help my parents.
They have worked so hard all their
lives. My dad still wakes up at 5 in the
morning to go to his construction job.
My mom sells food from home so I could
buy them a house. A nice comfortable
house. Nothing super crazy, just
something where they can finally relax.
That's a beautiful answer. You take care
of your family first.
Absolutely. Family comes first. After
that, okay, this may sound funny, but
I'd open a food truck business. I love
cooking. Like, I really love it. I
always dream about having a small burger
or a taco truck where people line up
because the food is so good.
I'd invest some of the money into
learning more about food,
maybe even travel to different countries
and learn how they cook.
Nice. That's practical and creative.
So, you'd become an entrepreneur.
Yes. But I'd also save a big part of the
money. I don't want to be rich for one
year and then poor again. I'll try to
make it grow. Maybe talk to a financial
advisor,
someone who knows how to manage money.
That way, I could make sure my future
family is safe, too.
Okay. Now, let's ask a teacher, Mr.
Thomas, if you had $1 million,
what would you do?
Wow, that's a fun question. Let's see.
First of all, I think I do something
most people don't expect. I wouldn't buy
a fancy car or a big house immediately.
What I would do is take a long break.
As a vertical, I could take one year off
to travel the world with my wife.
That sounds amazing.
Any specific places?
Yes, I'd love to go to to Japan,
Iceland, Morocco,
and Argentina.
I believe that travel teaches you more
than any book.
and I've been teaching for years.
I need fresh ideas, new inspiration.
I could visit the schools in other
countries too to learn how they teach
English and maybe bring those ideas
back.
So, in a way, you'd still be working,
just learning instead of teaching.
Exactly. Also, I could start a small
project for students who can't afford
English classes. Maybe a foundation or a
free YouTube channel where I teach
English in a new simple way for kids in
rural areas.
Education changes lives. If I can use my
money to give someone else a better
chance, I think that could be a good way
to use it.
All right,
Daniel, your turn.
$1 million lands in your bank account
today.
What do you do?
Okay, let me be honest. I'd freak out at
first. I mean, come on. It's a million
dollars.
But once I calm down, here's what I do.
First, I invest a big portion. I start a
business. So, I know that money that
just sits in the bank loses value.
I'd buy some real estate, maybe small
apartments to rent.
Passive income is key in 2025.
Smart. You're already thinking like a
millionaire.
I try.
Then I start building my startup idea.
I've had this app idea for years. It's a
language exchange app with realtime AI
translation
and video matching. People from
different countries can talk, learn
languages, and share culture.
I'd use part of the money to develop
that app, hire a small team, and launch
it.
Wow, that's modern. That sounds like
something people could use today.
Exactly.
I think the best way to use a big
opportunity like $1 million
is to create something that lasts,
something that helps others and grows
over time. And of course, I'd keep a
little for fun. Maybe a trip with
friends or a new laptop. But the goal is
to multiply it, not waste it.
Hey, Alejandra. Same question, my
friend. What would you do if you had $1
million?
Wow. I've never really thought about
that, but okay. Honestly, I think I
could take care of my grandparents
first.
They raised me when my parents had to
leave to work in another country. They
gave me everything, love, support, food.
Even when we had nothing so I could
first buy them a house
near the beach, they always dreamed
about living near the sea where it's
peaceful and quiet.
I would want them to live their last
years with joy.
That's really touching.
You're thinking with your heart.
Yes. Uh because I know money can't
disappear fast. But making someone happy
like that, it's forever.
Then I could invest in green energy and
maybe solar panels or wine farms.
I study engineering and I care a lot
about the planet. I want to use
technology to solve problems,
not to create them. And with $1 million,
maybe I could start something as small
that makes a difference.
Very impressive. Do you think you'd
change if you were rich?
No. I hope not. I want to stay the same,
just with more tools to help others.
That's my dream.
Mr. Lol, now we need your expert
opinion.
What would you do if you had $1 million?
All right, let me try to keep this
short, but it's hard. If I had that kind
of money, first I would donate a part of
it to mental health programs in a
school. I've seen too many students who
suffer quietly, anxiety, stress,
depression, and nobody talks about it.
I'd help create spaces where they can
talk to professionals.
That's a very unique answer.
We always talk about grades and tests,
but never feelings.
Money can't fix everything, but it can
open doors.
After that, I'd write a book, a math
book, but not like the boring ones, a
fun one with real life stories, humor,
games, and life lessons inside.
I want the students to enjoy learning.
That sounds like a game changer.
Exactly. And maybe I'd use a little
money to buy a small cabin in the
mountains.
Just a quiet place where I can write,
think, and rest from time to time. Even
teachers need a break. Right.
Okay. Last one for today. Jonathan,
you're a tech guy. What could you do
with $1 million?
Thanks for asking.
Honestly, I'd leave the country for a
year. I go travel not just for fun, but
to learn. I want to see how people live
in other places.
Asia,
Europe, Africa.
out live in cheap host and meet people,
learn new languages.
I believe you grow when you leave your
comfort zone.
That sounds adventurous.
And the money
I'd live with very little, maybe $1,000
a month. That means I can travel for
more than two years if I'm smart. But
while I travel, I'd build my dream
project, a platform that connects
freelancers from developing countries
with global clients.
So many people have talent, but no
opportunity.
I'd create that bridge.
Would you come back?
Yes, one day. But I'd come back with new
eyes, new experiences,
with a better idea of what really
matters, and hopefully with something I
built that helps others.
Wow, these answers were amazing.
Some dream of helping family, some of
building something new, and others of
changing the world. One small step at a
time.
What about you? What would you do with
$1 million?
Leave your answer in the comments in
English. This is your chance to practice
and to dream. Don't forget to like,

Academy. And remember, first step to
success is believing it's possible.

little more, please subscribe to the

support.
Excuse me. Do you need help with
something? Oh, good morning.
Good morning. Oh, yes. Thank you. I'm
looking for something
like soft white cheese, but I cannot
understand what is written here.
Oh, I know this one. That's a type of
fresh cheese they eat here a lot.
It's similar to cream cheese, but
saltier.
You can use it on bread or in salads.
Oh, interesting. In my country, we have
something similar.
But the name is very different.
That's why I couldn't find it.
Yeah, I understand. It's always tricky
when you go shopping in another country.
The packaging looks familiar, but the
words are confusing.
Exactly. By the way, your English is
very good. Are you from here?
Oh, no. I'm not from here either. I'm
just living in this country for work.
I'm actually from a country on the
American continent.
English is my native language, but I'm
learning the local language now.
Oh, that's nice.
I'm from a country in Asia. English is
not my first language,
but I use it when I travel. It helps a
lot. I learned it when I was in school.
Same here. English is useful everywhere
and it's great to meet people.
I mean, people from so many cultures.
This cheese brought us together.
Yes, a magical cheese. So, tell me
something. Do you eat this cheese often?
Now I do, but in my country, we don't
have this type of cheese. The first time
I saw it,
I thought it was butter. I made a
sandwich with way too much.
Oh no, that must have tasted strong or
not
very. But now I know how to use it. I've
lived here for a few months,
so I've learned about their food. The
first few weeks were interesting.
In my country, we usually eat rice with
almost every meal. And our cheese is
usually sweet or very mild. When I tried
the blue cheese here, I thought it was
rodent.
Yes, blue cheese is an adventure.
This smell can scare you before you even
taste it.
Also here people eat so much bread. In
my country we eat bread only sometimes.
Maybe for breakfast but here it's
breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Exactly. And not just bread. So many
kinds of bread. I've counted at least
10.
10 types in this store. In my country,
bread is usually soft and sliced for
sandwiches.
In my home country, we don't eat cheese
with bread like this. We use
seaweed, rice,
or noodles. So, cheese with bread feels
very strange.
I felt the same. But now I enjoy it. I
guess that's the beauty of travel.
You try new things, even the strange
ones. Of course, others are amazing.
Yes. And not only food. I noticed that
people here don't talk much on
public transportation.
In my country, it's normal to chat or
speak on the phone.
That's true. Here, people are very quiet
in buses or trains. I once laughed
loudly
while watching a video and everyone
looked at me like I committed a crime.
Oh no. Same for me. I said hello to
someone next to me on the tram
and they looked so uncomfortable.
I felt like I was being a weird person.
Here, personal space is very important.
Even in lines at the supermarket,
they don't stand close like in other
countries. At first, I thought the line
was empty.
Yeah. In my country, people stand very
close.
If you leave a big space, someone will
just go in front of you.
Also, greetings are different. In my
country, people usually shake hands
or maybe give a quick hug, but here
people give kisses on the cheek.
And
I never know if it's one, two, or three.
Oh, yes. That was confusing for me too.
The first time someone kissed me
on the cheek. I was frozen.
I didn't know what to do.
Now I just follow their lead unless I
panic and offer a handshake by accident.
And the eating habits in my country we
use chopsticks.
When I eat here,
I try to use knife and fork, but I feel
very slow. And that's not all.
I always forget which hand holds what.
Man, that's very confusing.
I know what you mean. I still get
confused about using a fork in the left
hand
and knife in the right. In my home
country, we often use only a fork or a
spoon.
Another thing, here people drink so much
coffee. In my country, we usually drink
tea.
And we drink it very hot. But here
coffee is everywhere. And they drink it
cold.
Yes. And the coffee sizes are so small
here. In my country, we drink giant
cups.
I ordered a large coffee once and got
something that looked like an espresso.
Same. I was looking for green tea in the
supermarket
and it was hard to find.
So many coffee options,
but only a few teas.
That's not good.
Well, every culture is different. That's
why I like talking to people like you.
We are both orangers but from different
worlds.
Still we understand each other.
Yes, I agree. Today I came to buy cheese
and I live with a new friend.
A cheese powered friendship.
That's the best kind.
Hey, uh, do you want to grab a coffee or
tea or beer after this?
I'd love to hear more about life in your
country. It's interesting.
And I'll bring some bread and cheese. We
can do an international food exchange.
Perfect. But I warned you, our snacks
are some are sweet, others are very
spicy.
Oh, come on. Bring it on. I like living
dangerously.
Then it's a plan. Let's check out and
start our cultural exchange with food
and fun.

Hello everyone. Welcome back to
Tangerine Academy, where real English
meets real life. Today's video is
something we all experience at some
point, a job interview, but not just any
interview. This is a situation where
someone really needs the job and he's
done everything he can to prepare. In
this episode, you listen to a powerful
and realistic conversation between a man
and the interviewer. You'll learn how to
answer questions with confidence, how to
express motivation and experience, and
how to stay calm even when you're
nervous. You'll also discover seven
useful vocabulary words and expressions
to upgrade your English. and we'll work
on pronunciation, shadowing, and
comprehension questions after the
conversation.
Let's dive in.
Good morning, Mr. Ria. It's nice to meet
you. Please have a seat.
Thank you, Mr. Jackson. I really
appreciate the opportunity to be here.
Of course. Let's begin. Tell me a little
bit about yourself and why you're
interested in this position.
Absolutely. Well, I have over 8 years of
experience in logistics and supply chain
management. I started my career as a
warehouse assistant and over time I
worked my way up to operations
supervisor.
I've always had a strong work ethic and
a passion for optimizing systems and
helping teams perform better. This role
feels like the natural next step for me,
especially because your company is known
for its innovation and leadership in the
field.
That's good to hear. You mentioned
optimizing systems.
Could you give me a specific example of
a time when you improved a process?
Yes, absolutely.
At my last job, I noticed there were
constant delays in shipment scheduling
due to poor communication between the
warehouse and the transportation team.
So I designed and implemented a shared
digital scheduling system that synced
both departments.
It reduced late shipments by 35%
in just two months. It was a gamecher
honestly.
Impressive. It sounds like you take
initiative.
How would you describe your management
style?
I could say I'm a mixed handson and
supportive. I believe in giving my team
clear expectations and then trusting
them to deliver. I'm always there for
guidance, but I try not to micromanage.
I've learned that empowering people
brings out their best work.
That's a great approach.
Now, let's talk about challenges.
Can you tell me about a time you failed
or faced a big obstacle at work?
Sure. There was a time we launched a new
inventory system and it didn't go
smoothly at all. The team was frustrated
and I didn't prepare enough training
ahead of time.
That wasn't me. But I didn't let it
spiral. I gathered feedback, created
weekly workshops, and worked overtime
with my staff until they felt confident.
It taught me that resilience is just as
important as preparation,
very honest, and I appreciate that. Now
I have to ask, why did you leave your
last job?
I was laid off during a restructuring.
The company had to downsize after losing
a major contract. It was hard, but I've
tried to see it as a chance to grow. I
took some time to upskill.
I completed a course in data analytics
which I believe is a strong asset for
logistics today.
Definitely data analytics is becoming
essential.
Let's talk about your future. Where do
you see yourself in 5 years?
Honestly, I see myself still with your
company but hopefully in a more
strategic role. I want to keep learning,
growing, and contributing.
Stability is important to me right now,
but so is professional development.
I've made some mistakes in the past by
staying too comfortable in jobs. I'm
ready to go the extra mile now.
That's exactly the kind of drive we're
looking for. One final question. Why
should we hire you?
I know many candidates may have similar
experience, but I believe I bring
something different. Commitment.
I've been in difficult situations before
and I've always delivered.
I've worked night shifts, weekends, even
holidays. Not because I had to, but
because I believe in showing up.
I'm reliable, a team player, and most of
all, I'm hungry to grow. I don't see
this just as a job. It's a chance to
rebuild, to prove myself and to bring
real value to your team.
I've prepared deeply for this because
frankly I need this job, not just
financially, but as a fresh start in my
life.
Thank you, Mr. Rivera. That was sincere
and powerful. We still have a few
interviews, but I have to say you've
made a strong impression.
Thank you, Mr. Jackson. I'm grateful for
your time and the chance to share my
story.
We'll be in touch very soon. Have a
great day. You too.
All right. Here are the seven key
expressions from the conversation with
meanings and examples to help you fully
understand and use them.
Number one, game changer.
The meaning is something that completely
changes the way things are done, usually
in a positive way.
For example,
the new online platform was a game
changer for our business. We doubled our
sales.
Example number two. Learning English was
a gamecher for my career. It opened so
many doors.
Now repeat after me. Game changer.
Game changer.
Number two, micromanage.
The meaning is to control every small
detail of someone's work instead of
trusting them to do it.
For example,
she quit her job because her boss used
to micromanage everything she said.
Example number two. I try not to
micromanage my team. I want them to feel
trusted and independent.
Now repeat after me. Micromanage.
Micromanage.
Number three, resilience.
The meaning is the ability to recover
from problems, stress, or failure.
For example,
life will always bring challenges.
Resilience helps us move forward.
Example number two.
Even after losing his job, his
resilience helped him start a new
career.
Now repeat after me. Resilience.
Resilience.
Number four, let off.
The meaning is to lose your job because
the company doesn't have enough work or
money, not because of something you did
wrong.
For example, he was let off during the
pandemic along with many co-workers.
Example number two. Getting let off was
difficult, but it pushed me to start my
own business.
Now repeat after me. Let off.
Let off.
Number five. Asset.
The meaning is something useful or
valuable, a strength or advantage.
For example, her bilingual skills are a
big asset to the team.
Example number two,
experience in customer service is an
asset when applying for sales jobs.
Now repeat after me. Asset
Asset
number six, professional development.
The meaning is activities and learning
that help you grow in your career.
For example,
I attend workshops and webinars for my
professional development.
Example number two, the company offers
great professional development programs
for employees.
Now repeat after me. Professional
development.
Professional development.
Number seven, go the extra mile.
The meaning is to do more than what is
required or expected.
For example, if you want a promotion,
you need to go the extra mile at work.
Example number two. She went the extra
mile by helping her teammates even after
hours.
Now repeat after me. Go the extra mile.
Go the extra mile.
Well done. Now shadowing section. Repeat
each phrase after a short pulse, trying
to match the rhythm, pronunciation, and
intonation.
Do this two to three times for each
sentence to train your mouth and ears in
real English flow.

Excellent. Now you will answer three
questions about the conversation.
You will be given some seconds to answer
the question and then I will give you
the answer. I recommend you to repeat
the conversation part again before you
go to this section. Remember these
questions are comprehension questions
and sometimes there is not an exact
answer but the main idea.
Let's start.
Question number one.
Why does Mr. Rivera really want the job
at the logistics company?
The answer is Mr. Rivera wants the job
not just for financial reasons but
because he sees it as a new beginning.
He was let off from his last job due to
restructuring
and he views this opportunity as a
chance to grow, proof himself and reveal
his career.
Number two, what mistake did Mr. Rivera
make at his previous job and what did he
learn from it?
The answer is Mr. Rivera implemented a
new inventory system without preparing
proper training for the stop. The roll
out didn't go smoothly and the team was
frustrated.
However, he fixed the problem by
organizing workshops and offering
support.
Question number three, what is Mr.
Rivera's long-term goal within the
company.
The answer is Mr. Rivera hopes to stay
with the company long-term and
eventually move into a more strategic
role. He's looking for both a stability
and professional development. And he
wants to grow by taking on more
responsibilities
in the future.
Great job everyone. Today we'll listen
to a full job interview and learn how to
express confidence, motivation, and
experience all in real useful English.
We also explored seven powerful
expressions that you can use in your
daily and professional life. Remember,
practice makes progress.

Liam, can we talk for a moment? It's important. 
Dad, I'm kind of busy right now. Can we talk  
later? No, Liam. We need to talk now. I know 
you're busy, but this is serious. Please put  
the phone down for a few minutes. Fine. What's 
this about? Is there something you want to tell  
me? Maybe something that's been happening at the 
school. Something you've been hiding? No, I don't  
know what you're talking about, Liam. I already 
know. I spoke with your teachers and I also spoke  
with your principal this morning. They told me 
you haven't been going to your classes. You've  
been missing a lot of days. They said you've been 
leaving in school without permission. They told  
me everything. That's not true. They are lying. 
I've been going to school. Liam, please don't lie  
to me. They gave me all the details. They even 
showed me the attendance records. I know you  
haven't been showing up. I also know your grades 
are getting worse. And your behavior has changed.  
You're not paying attention. You're not doing your 
homework and you're talking back to your teachers.  
Well, maybe I missed a few days, but it's 
not a big deal. Everyone skips sometimes. No,  
Liam, this is serious. It's not just one 
or two days. It's been several weeks now.  
Your teachers are worried. I'm worried. 
I need to know what's going on with you.  
Nothing's going on. Just leave me alone. 
Okay. Why do you care so much? Leon,  
you are my son. I've raised you since you were 
little. Of course, I care. I care because I love  
you and I want to help you. But you're pushing me 
away. I told you there's nothing to talk about.  
just forget it. If you don't want to talk, that's 
your choice. But you need to understand that there  
are consequences for your actions. From now 
on, you're grounded. You can't go out with  
your friends and you can't play video games or use 
your computer. You need time to think about your  
choices. What? That's not fair. You can't do that. 
Yes, I can. You've been skipping school and lying  
to me. You need to learn responsibility. You're 
not even my real father. You have no right to tell  
me what to do. You're right, Liam. I'm not your 
real father. I've never wanted to replace your  
parents. I know I can never do that. Your mom and 
dad, they were wonderful people. They loved you  
more than anything in this world. Then why are you 
pretending like you're my dad? I'm not pretending.  
I am your uncle. I am your mother's brother. 
But when your parents passed away, someone  
had to take care of you. I didn't do it because I 
had to. I did it because I love you. I raised you  
as my own. Because I wanted you to feel safe, to 
feel loved, to feel like you still had a family.  
You've always been like a son to me. I've been 
there for your birthdays, your school events,  
when you were sick, when you were scared. I've 
been here every day because I care. I know I can't  
ever take the place of your real dad, but that 
doesn't mean I don't love you like a father could.  
It's just sometimes I feel like you don't 
understand me. Maybe I don't always understand,  
Liam. But I always try. I am always here 
to listen. Even when you're angry with me,  
even when you say things that hurt, I know that 
deep inside you're hearting too. But shutting me  
out won't make the pain go away. I don't know what 
to do. That Liam, please talk to me. I know you're  
upset. I know it's not just about the school. 
There is something deeper bothering you. I can  
see it. You're not in trouble. If you tell me the 
truth, I just want to help you. It's hard to talk  
about. I don't even know where to start. Start 
wherever you can. I'm not going anywhere. I will  
sit here all night if I have to. You don't 
have to be alone with this. At the school,  
people talk. Some of the other kids, they've been 
calling me names. What kind of names, Liam? They  
say, "I'm the kid with no parents." They laugh and 
say things like, "Why would anyone want to raise  
someone like you?" Or, "You're just someone's 
responsibility." not really part of a family. Oh,  
Liam, I'm so sorry you've been going through 
this. They whisper about me in the holes. They  
pretend to feel sorry for me, but really they just 
think I'm strange. Some kids stopped hanging out  
with me. I guess they don't know how to talk to 
me anymore. I started escaping a school because  
because I just couldn't face them. I didn't want 
to sit there and feel like I don't belong. Why  
didn't you tell me sooner? You don't have to go 
through this alone. Because I thought you wouldn't  
understand. You're not my real dad. I thought 
maybe you would think the same way they do. Liam,  
listen to me carefully. What those kids are saying 
is cruel, unfair, and completely wrong. You are  
not just a responsibility. You are not a burden. 
You are family. You have always been family to me.  
But they said, "I don't really belong anywhere." 
That's not true. You belong right here with me.  
Love isn't about blood. It's about what we 
do, how we care, how we stand by each other.  
You may have lost your parents. And yes, I am 
your uncle by birth. But in my heart, you are  
my son. You always have been. But sometimes 
I feel so angry. I miss my parents. I don't  
even remember my mom's voice anymore. I try, but 
it's like it's disappearing. I miss your mom, too.  
She was my sister. She was one of the kindest 
people I've ever known. And I know she would  
be proud of you. She would want you to feel loved, 
not alone. You are the most important part of what  
she left behind. I promised her I would take care 
of you. not just feed you or give you a place to  
sleep, but really raise you with love. Sometimes 
I feel like I don't know who I am without them.  
You're still discovering who you are. That's okay. 
You are not just your pain. You are not just your  
past. You are who you decide to become. and I 
will be here to help you build that life. What  
if those kids keep laughing at me? What if I keep 
feeling like this? Sometimes people say terrible  
things because they don't know how to be kind. 
Sometimes they laugh because they don't understand  
your story or because they feel small themselves. 
You don't have to let their words control your  
life. But it is still hearts. Of course it does. 
But when something hurts, you don't run from it.  
You talk about it. You ask for help. You lean on 
your family. I'm your family. I want you to come  
to me. We can face these things together. Do you 
really think I can go back to school? I think you  
can. I think you are stronger than you know. And 
if you're afraid, I'll go with you. I'll speak  
to your teachers. I'll help you find ways to deal 
with this. But what about what I said earlier? I  
said you're not my real father. that heart, Liam. 
I won't lie. But I also know you said it because  
you were angry and hurting. I don't blame you. 
I know you didn't mean to push me away. I didn't  
mean it. I was just so frustrated. Thank you for 
telling me that. But even if you really believed  
it, it wouldn't change how I feel about you. I 
would still be here, still trying to help you  
grow, still loving you. Nothing can change 
that. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm really proud you  
still call me that. I think I always will. That 
means everything to me. So, am I still grounded?
Well, I think we can talk about that. How 
about this? You start going back to school  
and we work through this together. 
You can have some of your games back,  
but you have to talk to me when something is 
wrong. No more secrets. Deal. Come here. Remember,  
family isn't always about who gave you life. 
Sometimes it's about who stands by you and  
loves you no matter what. Thank you, Dad. If you 
could improve your English a little more, please

a friend. Thank you very much for your support.
Daniel, you're not eating your dinner. You've 
been sitting there for 20 minutes. Just moving  
the food around your plate. What's wrong? 
You usually love this meal. Your mom made  
your favorite today. Are you feeling sick? No, I'm 
fine, Dad. I just don't have an appetite tonight.  
I'm not really hungry. That's strange. You 
didn't eat much at lunch either. You've been  
quiet all day. Are you sure you're okay? 
You can tell me anything. You know that,  
right? Yeah, I know that. I just don't 
feel like talking right now. It's nothing.  
nothing. You know, when parents hear it's 
nothing, it usually means it's something. I  
can see in your face that something is bothering 
you. But I won't force you to talk. I'll just  
sit here and keep you company. Thanks, Dad. 
So, tell me, how's school going these days?  
Are your classes still fun? You were really 
enjoying your science project last week. Yeah,  
school is fine. Science is okay. We finished 
the project yesterday. Great. And what about  
your friends? Are you still hanging out with 
Leo and Chris? Yeah, we are still friends.  
We play soccer after school sometimes. Good. I'm 
glad you have good friends around you. And hey, is  
there is there someone you like at the school? You 
know, someone special? You are at that age now.  
Oh, Dad. Come on. I don't want to talk about that. 
Okay. Okay. But you can tell me. It's just you and  
me here. I won't laugh or tell anyone. I'm just 
curious. I don't know. It's kind of complicated.  
Complicated. Now you really have my attention. You 
know, sometimes talking about these things helps.  
You might feel a little better. Okay. But please 
don't make it a big deal. I promise I'll just  
listen. Well, I've been seeing this girl. Her name 
is Emily. We've been spending time together for a  
few weeks now. It just kind of happened. Oh, wow. 
That's great, Daniel. I'm really happy for you.  
Tell me more. How did you meet her? We met at the 
school. She's in my history class. I didn't really  
notice her at first, but one day we got paired 
for a group project. And we started talking.  
She's funny, really smart, and easy to talk to. 
I liked her right away. That's wonderful. And  
how did you go from working on a project to, 
you know, being more than just friends? Well,  
after we finished the project, we kept texting. 
We would talk after school for hours. Then she  
invited me to her cousin's birthday party. We 
had a lot of fun there. I guess after that we  
just started seeing each other more. She said she 
liked me and I told her I like her too. That's  
amazing song. Your first real relationship. You 
look happy when you talk about her. Yeah, I really  
like her. I like spending time with her. She 
makes me laugh and I feel good when I'm with her.  
That's great to hear. So, what's she like? Um, I 
mean, what does she like to do? She loves music.  
She plays the guitar and she writes songs. She's 
also really into photography. She's always taking  
pictures of everything. She's kind to everyone and 
super popular at the school. I really admire her.  
Sounds like you found a wonderful person, 
but earlier you said things were a little  
complicated. What did you mean by that? Well, 
it's kind of a small thing. It's not really  
important. It's just something that happened a 
few days ago. If it's bothering you this much,  
it's not a small thing. You can tell me, Daniel. 
I won't get mad. I just want to understand. Okay.  
So, there was this game at a party. You know, one 
of those silly games where people do dares. Emily  
was playing with some of her friends and as a part 
of a dare, she kissed another boy. Oh, I see. And  
how did you feel about that? I mean, I didn't like 
it, of course, but she said it was just a game,  
nothing serious. She said it didn't mean anything 
and everyone was just having fun. She apologized  
and said, "I shouldn't worry about it." M. And 
what do you think? Do you believe her? I want  
to believe her. I mean, I love her, Dad. I don't 
want to lose her over something silly like this.  
But if it was so silly, why are you feeling this 
way? Why can't you eat? Why does it bother you so  
much? I don't know. I guess it's because I can't 
stop thinking about it. Every time I remember,  
I feel I don't know, like I'm not enough, 
like maybe I'm not important to her.  
That's a very real feeling song and I think we 
should talk more about it. Daniel, listen. I know  
these feelings are very strong. Love is wonderful, 
but it can also be confusing and painful,  
especially when you are young and still learning 
about yourself. When someone you care about does  
something that hurts you, even if they say it 
was just a game, it's normal to feel angry,  
sad, or even lost. But dad, she said it didn't 
mean anything. Everyone else there thought it  
was just a silly game. I don't want to be the 
only one making it a big problem. I understand  
you don't want to seem dramatic or jealous, 
but you also need to listen to your heart. If  
it's hurting you this much, then it's not silly to 
you. Your feelings are real. You're not wrong for  
feeling this way. Yeah, but what if I forgive her 
and just to try to forget about it? I really love  
her that I don't want to lose her over something 
like this. Maybe I'm just overreacting. Let me  
tell you something, Daniel. When I was about your 
age, I was in a very similar situation. I had a  
girlfriend. I thought she was the most amazing 
person in the world. I trusted her completely.  
One day, just like you, I found out she kissed 
another guy at the party. She told me the same  
thing. She said it was just a game, just for fun. 
At first, I told myself I could live with it.  
I told myself that I loved her too much to walk 
away. What happened, Dad? Well, I stayed with her  
for a while, but I noticed something. Even though 
I told her I was okay, inside I was still hurt. I  
couldn't forget it. Every time she went to a party 
or hung out with other people, I started to feel  
insecure. I started asking myself, will she do 
it again? I didn't trust her completely anymore.
Did you break up with her? Yes. After some time, 
I realized something very important. Love is not  
just about feelings. Love is about respect, trust, 
and how people make you feel about yourself. If  
the person If the person you love makes you 
feel small or makes you question your value,  
that's not real love. Real love should 
make you feel safe, respected, and valued.  
But I don't want to leave her that I still love 
her. I know, son. Love doesn't just disappear  
because something bad happens. You can still 
love someone who hurt you. That's what makes this  
situation so difficult. But sometimes you need to 
love yourself more than you love the other person.  
I mean, you need to protect your heart. You 
need to make sure you are with someone who makes  
you feel good about what you are. Someone who 
respects you enough to think about your feelings,  
not just their fun. But maybe it really was 
just a game. Maybe it didn't mean anything.  
That might be true, but you have to ask yourself, 
can you really trust her again? Can you feel happy  
in this relationship? Or will this always stay in 
your mind? I don't know. I keep thinking about it  
every day. Exactly. Sometimes the biggest problem 
is not what happened. It's how it makes you feel  
afterward. If you can't find peace, if you feel 
you're always going to worry, that's not healthy.  
But if I break up with her, I feel like I lost 
something so special. I'm afraid I'll miss her too  
much. Yes, you will miss her. That's part of life. 
But you will also feel free. Free from the pain,  
free from the worry, and you'll open a space in 
your life for someone else who will give you the  
respect you deserve. It's so hard that I never 
thought love could be this hard. It's one of the  
hardest things. Song. It's easy to fall in love. 
It's hard to make the right choices when love  
gets complicated. But how do I know what the right 
choice is? You listen to your heart, but you also  
listen to your mind. Ask yourself, am I happy? Do 
I trust her? Do I feel safe? If the answers are  
no, maybe it's time to think carefully. I still 
feel like I want to forgive her. And that's okay,  
too. But remember, if you choose to forgive her, 
it's important to really forgive, not to keep  
thinking about it every day. If you stay, stay 
with peace. If you can't find peace, maybe you  
need to step away. What could you do if you were 
me? I can't decide for you. I can only tell you  
what I learned. When I stayed with someone who 
didn't respect me, I lost my self-confidence. I  
lost myself for a while. When I finally walked 
away, I found myself again, I became stronger.  
It's scary to think about losing her. Yes, but 
sometimes we must lose something to find something  
better later. You're still young, Daniel. You will 
love again. You will meet people who will treat  
you well, who will care about your feelings. This 
is just the beginning of your story. Thanks, Dad.  
I I really needed to talk about this. I'm always 
here for you. Always. And remember, loving someone  
is beautiful, but loving yourself is the most 
important thing. Yeah, I think I understand now.  
It's not an easy choice, but I know what I need to 
think about. Good. Take your time. You don't have  
to decide right now. Just promise me you'll put 
yourself first. I promise that. That's all I can  
ask. Now, how about we warm up your dinner? 
I think you might be a little hungry now.  
Yeah, maybe I am. If you could improve your

Hello English learners. Welcome back to your 
favorite place to learn English for real life.  
In today's lesson, we're listening to a real life 
office conversation during a coffee break. Two  
co-workers are talking about one of them being 
sent abroad by the company. We'll hear what  
skills and habits helped him get selected and 
the advice he gives his friend. And of course,  
we'll learn seven amazing phrases that are super 
important. Later, we'll practice with vocabulary  
with examples, shadowing with real lines from 
the conversation, comprehension questions,  
a strong reflection to help you grow. Ready to 
level up your business English? Then let's go.
Hey, Jason, I heard some buzz around the office. 
Are you really going to Tokyo next month on a  
business trip? Yeah, man. It's official. I just 
got the confirmation email yesterday. Flights,  
hotel, everything pad by the company. That's 
incredible. I mean, I've always dreamed of  
that kind of opportunity. How did you even 
get chosen? I thought those trips were for  
upper management. Normally, yes. But the truth is, 
companies are starting to invest in employees who  
show initiative and a strong cross functional 
skills. I've been working closely with the  
marketing and logistics team lately. So, I've 
become kind of a bridge between departments.
So, you're saying collaboration played a 
big role? Exactly. One thing I've learned  
is that if you want opportunities like this, 
you need to position yourself as indispensable.  
If they see you as someone who can represent the 
company well in a global setting, they'll choose  
you. That makes sense. But apart from being a team 
player, what else matters? Honestly, your ability  
to communicate with clarity, especially in high 
stakes situations. When I gave that presentation  
last quarter to the regional directors, I made 
sure every point was tight and tailored to their  
interests. That was a torn point, right? I I 
remember that everyone said you were on fire  
that day. Well, thank you. But it's also about 
soft skills. You need emotional intelligence,  
cultural awareness, and the ability to adapt 
on the fly. Business trips aren't vacations.  
You have to be productive, respectful, and sharp. 
Totally. So, how should someone prepare if they  
want that kind of opportunity? First, build 
a strong professional presence. That means  
dressing the part, speaking confidently, and 
being consistent. Then start volunteering for  
cross department projects. Show you are proactive 
and language skills. Absolutely. Being bilingual  
or at least conversational in other languages is a 
major plus. But even more important is knowing how  
to make connections. The company trust people who 
can create meaningful relationships abroad. Man,  
I wish I'd started building that kind 
of profile sooner. It's never too late.  
Start small. Offer help outside your job 
description. Read about other markets.  
When you become globally minded, people notice. I 
love that. So, when are you flying out? Two weeks.  
I'm giving a presentation, attending two client 
meetings, and even visiting a tech expo on behalf  
of the firm. Sounds intense. It is, but that's the 
thrill. Business trips like this push you to grow.  
You come back with more knowledge, confidence, 
and even new connections. Okay. Last question.  
What's your number one tip? Simple. Don't 
wait for someone to give you the opportunity.  
Create value every day. When the moment comes, 
you'll already be the obvious choice. Thanks,  
man. You just gave me a whole new perspective. 
Anytime. And who knows, maybe next time we'll  
be traveling together. All right, let's explore 
the seven advanced and essential phrases from  
the conversation. These are powerful expressions 
you can use in real life to sound more fluent and  
clear. We will see the meaning, two examples, and 
pronunciation. Number one, initiative. The meaning  
is the ability to take charge or begin something 
before others do. For example, she showed  
initiative by solving the issue before the manager 
even noticed. Example two, taking initiative at  
work can lead to promotions and recognition. 
Now repeat after me. Initiative. Initiative.
Number two, position yourself as 
indispensable. The meaning is make  
yourself so useful and valuable that the 
team can't function well without you.  
Example one, he worked hard to position himself 
as indispensable to the client team. Example two,  
if you want to travel for work, 
you need to position yourself as  
indispensable. Now repeat after me. 
Position yourself as indispensable.
Position yourself as indispensable.
Number three, communicate with clarity. 
The meaning is express ideas clearly and  
effectively. Example one, great leaders know how 
to communicate with clarity in stressful moments.  
Example two. If you want 
to impress during meetings,  
learn to communicate with clarity. Now 
repeat after me. Communicate with clarity.
Communicate with clarity.
Number four, adapt on the fly. The meaning is 
adjust quickly and effectively in changing or  
unpredictable situations. Example one, traveling 
for work requires the ability to adapt on the fly.  
Example two. When the presentation 
equipment failed, she adapted on  
the fly and used her laptop. Now 
repeat after me. Adapt on the fly.
Adapt on the fly.
Number five, professional presence. The 
way you present yourself in a professional  
setting includes appearance, communication, 
and behavior. Example one, he had a strong  
professional presence. People listened when he 
spoke. Example two, your professional presence  
is just as important as you resume. Now 
repeat after me. Professional presence.
Professional presence.
Number six, globally minded. The meaning 
is a mindset that understands and respects  
different cultures and global perspectives. 
Example one, she's very globally minded.  
She reads international news and studies foreign 
markets. Example two, companies want employees  
who are globally minded, not just locally 
smart. Now repeat after me. Globally minded.
Globally minded.
Number seven, create value. The meaning is 
contribute something meaningful or useful to  
your team, company or clients. Example 
one, every task is a chance to create  
value even if it seems small. Example 
two, he didn't wait for instructions.  
He found ways to create value from day 
one. Now repeat after me. Create value.
Create value.
Well done. Now shadowing section. 
Repeat each phrase after a short pulse,  
trying to match the rhythm, pronunciation, 
and intonation. Do this two to three times  
for each sentence to train your 
mouth and ears in real English  
flow. in employees who show initiative 
and a strong cross functional skills.
You need to position yourself as indispensable.
Honestly, your ability to communicate with clarity
and the ability to adapt on the fly.
First, build a strong professional presence.
When you become globally minded, people notice.
Create value every day. When the moment 
comes, you'll already be the obvious choice.
Excellent. Now you will answer three 
questions about the conversation. You  
will be given some seconds to answer 
the question and then I will give you  
the answer. I recommend you to repeat the 
conversation part again before you go to  
this section. Remember these questions are 
comprehension questions and sometimes there  
is not an exact answer but the main idea. Let's 
start. Number one, why is Jason going to Tokyo?
The answer is because his company chose him 
for a business trip due to his initiative,  
ability to collaborate, and strong communication 
skills. Number two, what skills or habits does  
Jason say are important to be chosen for a 
business trip? The answer is showing initiative,  
being indispensable, communicating with clarity, 
adapting on the fly, having a strong professional  
presence, and being globally minded. Number three, 
what final advice does Jason give to Carlos?
The answer is he tells Carlos not to wait 
for opportunities but to create value every  
day so that when the time comes he 
will already be the obvious choice.
Great job everyone. You've just completed a 
powerful lesson where we explored a meaningful  
debate and learned seven essential vocabulary 
phrases that can really elevate your English.

words. It's about expressing your ideas,  
values, and emotions. And topics like this help

Hey, Thiago. How's your English going these days? 
Are you improving? Honestly, not really. I go to  
class, I do the exercises, but I feel like I'm 
learning too slowly. Sometimes I wonder if I'm  
wasting my time. Wow, I feel the same. I keep 
studying, but I still can't speak well. I want  
to learn English faster, but I don't know how. 
Yeah, me too. It's like we follow the rules,  
we do the homework, but we don't really speak 
better. I want to speak English quickly and  
feel comfortable when I talk. I always hear the 
same old advice. Watch movies, listen to music,  
read books, but I do those things and it's still 
too slow. Exactly. I feel like I need something  
new, something modern that really works. Hey, why 
don't we ask our teachers? Maybe they know better  
ways to learn. Maybe they have new ideas that 
they don't usually tell the whole class. That's  
a smart. Let's find them and ask. But let's take 
turns. You can ask the first teacher and I'll ask  
the next one. Look, there's Mr. Thomas. I'll ask 
him. Mr. Thomas, can I ask you something quickly?
Of course, Patrick. What's your question? I want 
to learn English faster, but I don't want the same  
advice like watch movies or read books. I want 
something different, something that really helps.  
That's a great question. Let me tell you this. 
Your ears are more important than your eyes. What  
do you mean? Many students spend a lot of time 
reading and writing, but language is sound first.  
If you want to speak English fast, you need to 
train your ears every day, listen to English all  
the time, even if you don't understand everything. 
So listening is more important than reading.  
Yes, you learned your first language by listening 
to your parents for years before you read  
anything. It's the same with English. Listen to 
English podcasts, YouTube videos, songs, anything.  
Your brain will start learning sounds, rhythm, and 
natural speech. Even if I don't understand. Yes,  
even if you understand only 30% at first, 
listening trains your brain. When you listen  
a lot, you will start to hear words and phrases 
again and again. It becomes familiar and soon  
you can speak it too. Wow, I didn't know that. 
I always focused on reading. Reading is good,  
but listening is faster for speaking. Fill your 
day with English sounds. Thank you so much,  
Mr. Thomas. That's a great tip. You're welcome, 
Patrick. Keep going. That was interesting.  
I always listen a little, but maybe I need 
to listen more. Like a lot more. Yeah,  
it really makes sense. Okay, now it's 
your turn to ask. Look, there's Mr.  
Brown. I'll ask him. Mr. Brown, can I ask you 
something? Sure, Thiago. What's on your mind?  
What is the best way to learn English fast? I 
want something different from the normal tips. Oh,  
I love this question. Let me tell you something 
very powerful. You need to speak before you are  
ready. Speak before I'm ready. But isn't that bad? 
What if I make mistakes? That's the point. If you  
wait until you feel ready, you will never speak. 
You will always think, "I need more practice. I  
need more words." But actually, you learn faster 
when you start speaking now, even with mistakes.  
So I should speak even if my English is not 
perfect. Exactly. Your English will never  
be perfect in the beginning. You have to start 
speaking early. Make mistakes, learn from them and  
speak more. When you speak before you are ready, 
your brain works harder. It's the best practice.  
But sometimes I feel nervous when I speak. 
That's very normal. Everybody feels that.  
But the students who learn fastest are the ones 
who speak anyway. They don't wait. I always wait.  
Maybe that's why I learn slowly. Yes, waiting is 
the enemy. Speak in class. Speak with friends.  
Speak even when you feel shy. Use your English as 
soon as possible. Okay, I will try to speak more  
even if I make mistakes. That's the best way to 
grow. I promise it works. Thank you, Mr. Brown.  
You're welcome, Theiago. Keep going. You're doing 
great. Wow, that was really good tip. I always  
wait because I feel nervous, but maybe that's why 
I'm not improving. Yeah, me too. I always think I  
need more vocabulary first, but now I understand. 
I need to start speaking now. Okay, let's ask one  
more teacher. Look, there's Mr. Daniel. Okay, 
it's your turn to ask this time. Mr. Daniel,  
can I ask you something? Of course, Patrick, 
what's going on? Thiago and I are looking for  
the best ways to learn English fast, but we don't 
want the usual answers. We want something really  
modern and useful. Oh, I love this question. I 
have something special for you. Here's my advice.  
Practice in real time with real people using real 
apps. What do you mean? Many students only speak  
in class, but you can talk to people from all 
over the world using free apps like um Tandem,  
Hello Talk, or Speaky. You can send text messages, 
make phone calls, or even have video chats with  
native speakers. I didn't know about those apps. 
I thought I had to travel to speak to people. No,  
you can have international friends right now from 
your phone. When you practice in real time with  
real people, you learn how to speak naturally. 
It's different from practicing in class.
But I'm scared to talk to strangers.  
That's normal at first, but most people on these 
apps want to learn to. Many of them are friendly  
and patient. And remember, you can choose to 
chat by text first if you feel nervous about  
speaking. So, I can make real conversations 
with people in other countries now. Exactly.  
And that's the fastest way to improve. Real 
people, real situations, real mistakes. That's how  
you learn quickly. Thank you so much, Mr. Daniel. 
I'm going to try those apps. You'll see great  
results. Go for it, Thiago. I feel like we just 
found gold with those tips. Yeah, I really feel  
motivated now. But you know what? Maybe we can 
find even more good advice. Yes. Let's keep going.  
I'll ask the next teacher and then you ask the 
one after that. Deal. Look, there's uh Oh, there's  
Mr. Brown again. Go ask him. Mr. around. Hello 
again. Um, can I ask you something else? Sure,  
Patrick. What's your question this time? Theiago 
and I are collecting the best tips to learn  
English fast. Uh, we want modern ideas, something 
really useful. What would you say is the best way?  
Oh, I have one of my favorite methods. It's called 
the 8020 rule. I've heard about it, but I don't  
really understand. Can you explain? Of course. 
The 8020 rule means this. 80% of your English  
progress will come from just 20% of what you 
study. So instead of trying to study everything,  
you should focus only on the most useful and 
most common words, expressions, and situations.
So I don't need to learn thousands of difficult 
words. Exactly. You're going to speak English  
well by focusing on the most common 1,00 to 1,500 
words. When you focus on the words you actually  
use every day, you learn faster because you can 
practice them often. That's really helpful. I used  
to waste time learning words I never used. Yes, 
that's the mistake many students make. Focus on  
the words that appear in daily life. Master them 
first. The more you repeat them in conversation,  
the faster you will improve. So, a small focus, 
big results. Exactly. The key is not to study  
everything. The key is to study the right things. 
Thank you, Mr. Brown. I'll focus my time on the  
most important words. That's a smart way. Keep 
going, Patrick. Okay, your turn now. Look,  
there's Mr. Adam. Go ask him. Mr. Adam, can 
I ask you something quickly? Sure, what's  
your question? Patrick and I are asking teachers, 
what's the best way to learn English fast? We want  
something modern and something that really works. 
That's a great question. I'll tell you something  
powerful. Use your hobbies to learn English. Use 
my hobbies? How? It's simple. Do what you already  
love but in English. If you love football, watch 
football games in English. If you love cooking,  
watch cooking videos in English. If you love video 
games, play in English and talk to other players.  
Oh, so I can mix English with the things I already 
enjoy. Exactly. When you connect English with your  
hobbies, you stay interested. You don't feel 
bored because you are doing something you like.  
It's the easiest way to spend many hours with 
English without feeling tired. That's smart. I  
I love music. Maybe I can start learning English 
songs and understand the lyrics. Yes. And you can  
sing them, too. Music is a great way to improve 
pronunciation and vocabulary. You can also follow  
English speakaking singers on social media. When 
you connect English to your passion, you never  
stop learning. That's really exciting. I've never 
thought about using my hobbies like this. It makes  
learning natural. It doesn't feel like homework. 
You just enjoy English. Thank you, Mr. Adam.  
I'm going to start today. Great. Remember, make 
English your hobby. Wow, your tip sounds really  
good. I love movies, so I can start watching only 
in English now. And I follow English singers. It's  
fun and it helps me. Okay, one more teacher. 
There's Mr. Pots over there. I'll ask him.  
Mr. Pots, can I ask you something? Of course, 
Patrick. What's your question? We're collecting  
fast and modern ways to learn English. What's 
your best advice? I have something very useful.  
Learn with a small daily challenges. Many 
students try to do too much in one day.  
They study for hours and then feel tired. It's 
better to give yourself a small goals every  
day. Can you give me one example? Sure. Today's 
challenge can be learn five new useful words and  
use them in three sentences. Tomorrow's challenge 
can be listen to 10 minutes of an English podcast.  
The next day's challenge can be speaking English 
for five minutes without stopping. So the small  
steps every day. Yes, it's easier for your brain 
to remember small pieces. The small daily wins  
will give you big results. When you do something 
every day, you create a habit. And habits are the  
key to fast learning. That sounds easy to follow. 
Sometimes I try to study too much and then I stop  
for days. Exactly. Many students try to do 
too much and they give up. But when you have  
a small challenge every day, you keep moving 
forward. You feel happy when you complete it.  
Thank you Mr. Pots. I will start doing a small 
challenges every day. Good. Remember every day  
one small step you will see your English 
grow fast. These tips are really modern and  
practical and we can start using them right 
now. Yes. I'm going to choose five new words  
today and use them in sentences. And I'm going 
to find English songs from my favorite singers  
and start learning the lyrics. Oh, I have an 
idea. Why don't we ask the people watching  
this video? Good idea. All right. What is your 
best advice to learn and speak English fast?

Hey Frankie, long time no see you. I 
got a package for you from your dad.
Straight from France. He told me to 
bring it today. How are you, my boy?
Hey, Uncle Wrong. Thanks. You 
can leave it on the table.
Wow. Wow. Wait a minute. 
What's that face? What's wrong?
You look like someone just stole 
your favorite sandwich. Are you okay?
Yeah. I mean, not really, 
but it's nothing important.
Come on, Frankie. I know you since 
you were in diapers. What happened?
Don't lie to your uncle Ron. 
Talk to me. What's going on?
It's a little embarrassing, Uncle. I 
don't really want to talk about it.
When has that ever stopped you before? 
I've seen you cry over a broken video game.
Oh boy. You can talk to me about 
anything. Come on, let it out.
Okay, fine. I just I don't know. Lately,  
I feel really bad. I feel lonely. It's been 
a long time since I had a girlfriend. And  
every time I tried to to start something with 
someone, it doesn't work. Nothing ever works.
So, that's what's been bothering 
you, huh? love problems.
You know, I had a feeling. I mean, 
you've been avoiding family dinners
and not answering texts. Then I thought 
something was not okay. Tell me more.
I mean, I'm almost 40. My friends are 
married. Some of them already have two kids.
They have houses, family 
vacations, and someone to love.
And me, I go to work, eat frozen 
pizza, and watch TV shows alone.  
I thought I thought by now I would have a 
wife, maybe a little boy or girl, but nothing.
Oh, Frankie, that's a hard feeling. But 
I want you to listen to me. Being single  
at 40 is not a crime. It doesn't 
mean something is wrong with you.
I don't know. It feels like 
something is wrong with me, uncle.
Maybe I'm not goodlooking. 
Maybe I'm too boring. Maybe
I don't have what women are looking 
for. Maybe I missed my chance.
Wait there. Hold your horses. Let's 
not fall into the trap of selfhate.
Look at you. You're smart. You have 
a job. You're kind. You're funny.
Okay, maybe a little too obsessed with 
pizza, but that's not the end of the world.
I don't know, Uncle. Every time I talk 
to a girl and start to like her, it just,  
how can I say it? Goes wrong. She loses interest.  
or I get nervous or we don't connect and 
then boom, I'm alone again. One more time.
Let me tell you something important, Frankie. 
Relationships are not like like instant noodles.  
You don't just add water and wait three minutes.
What I mean is that relationships, 
they take time and sometimes
people are just not ready or the 
connection isn't right. And that's okay.
But why does it feel like everyone else 
is getting it right and I'm just stuck?
That's simple. Because you're 
comparing your life to their outside.
You see the pictures on social media, 
the happy couples, the smiling babies.
But you don't see the rest. The 
arguments, the stress, the sacrifices.
Trust me, I've been married for 38 years. 
It's not a fairy tale every day. Yeah,  
I guess I only see the good 
parts from the outside.
Exactly. And listen, being single is 
not a failure. It's just a season.
Some people meet the right person at 
20, others at 50. Life is not a race.  
It's not a competition to see who 
gets married first. Of course not.
It's about being ready when 
it finally happens. That's it.
I feel like what if it never happens? 
What if I'm just meant to be alone?
Then you make peace with your 
own company. And who knows,
sometimes when we stop looking so hard, 
love finds us. You might meet someone  
when you least expect it at the store, on 
a bus, during a boring meeting at work.  
But you have to stop thinking you're 
not enough. You are enough, Frankie.
You don't need to be taller, richer, 
more handsome. You just need to be you.
And the right person will see that and 
love you because of it, not in spite of it.  
Well, I needed to hear that. I've 
been so hard on myself lately.
I even stopped going out. I 
just thought, what's the point?
The point is living your life fully, 
no matter your relationship status.  
Travel, learn new things, take care 
of yourself, and love it will come.
And when it does, you'll be ready. 
Not desperate, not lost, but ready.
Thanks, Uncle Ron. Really, I feel a 
little better now. Maybe I've been
I've been too focused on what I don't 
have instead of enjoying what I do have.
That's the spirit. And hey, I was 
single until I was 38. And look at  
me now. Happily married with three crazy 
grandkids. Life works in mysterious ways.
So, you're saying there's still hope for me?
Hope, Frankie. There is more than hope. 
There is a whole future ahead of you.  
Just be patient, be open, and 
keep being the good man you are.
And next time you start feeling down, 
remember your uncle Ron believes in you.
Thanks, Uncle. And thanks for 
the package and the live advice.

Hello there English learners. Today's lesson is 
not just about language. It's about real life.  
Have you ever wondered why so many adults 
seem exhausted all the time? Why parents,  
your teachers, your neighbors always look like 
they are carrying the weight of the world?  
In today's episode, we'll hear a touching and 
powerful conversation between a young boy and  
his father. The boy is curious. He wants to know 
why adults are always tired. And what happens next  
might surprise you. While you listen, focus on new 
vocabulary in context, real life expressions you  
can use in your daily conversations. the emotional 
flow of a spoken English. Let's jump into it.
Dad, can I ask you something? I don't 
mean to bother you or anything, but I've  
been thinking about this a lot lately. Sure, 
Liam. What is it? You can always talk to me.  
Why are you always tired? Like really tired. Every 
day when you get home, you just look like you're  
done. You barely talk sometimes, do it quickly, 
and then just sit quietly or go to sleep early.  
And it's not only you that mom looks tired, 
too. Uncle Steve, my teachers at school, even  
the people I see on the bus, they all look like 
they've had enough. Why is that? Why are adultles  
so tired all the time? Wow, that's a really good 
question. Not many people ask that. It's something  
even adults don't talk about. You're right. 
We are tired and not just physically. A lot of  
adults walk around every day feeling emotionally 
worn out even when they've slept enough. It's  
something that builds slowly like pressure under 
the surface. But I don't get it. Is it the job? I  
mean, I know you work hard, but is work that 
bad? Work is part of it, sure, but it's more  
than that. There are so many responsibilities 
that come with being an adult. Paying bills,  
helping family, dealing with unexpected problems. 
planning for the future. It all adds up. And often  
we don't even get a break to think or breathe. 
Some days I feel like I'm just running on fumes.  
Like I'm going going going but I have no energy 
left inside. So, it's like pretending to have  
energy when you don't. Exactly. You put on a 
smile. You keep moving. You say you're fine  
because you have to, but deep inside you feel like 
you're carrying a heavy load no one else can see.  
I try to stay positive, but there are days I 
feel like I'm in survival mode, just trying to  
make it through the day without falling apart. 
That sounds hard. But is that just what being a
ways? Yes. But it shouldn't be. And 
it doesn't have to be all the time.  
But society teaches us to keep working, to stay 
busy, to always do more. Resting feels like a  
luxury sometimes. You know, I haven't taken a real 
vacation in 3 years. Every time we plan something,  
something else comes up. That's why so many 
people feel burned out. They are doing too much  
and getting too little back. But don't adults 
do fun things too, like watch shows, go out,  
hang with friends, sure, but even those things 
start to feel like chores when you're tired. And  
a lot of adults forget what makes them happy. 
They lose connection to what brings them joy.  
Sometimes they become disconnected from joy and 
that's when life starts to feel empty even if  
everything looks okay on the outside. So adults 
are sad. Not always. We're not always sad, Liam.  
Many of us are just overwhelmed. There's this 
constant mental list in our heads. What needs to  
be done? What hasn't been finished? What could 
go wrong? We carry it all day. Even at night,  
it's exhausting. And the truth is, no one really 
teaches you how to handle that when you grow up.  
You just figure it out or try to. That doesn't 
sound like what I thought could be like.  
It's different from what kids imagine. 
That's true. But there's beauty in it,  
too. Even in the tiredness, there's love. You 
wake up early because you love your family.  
You work hard because you care about your future. 
And even if you are exhausted, there's something  
beautiful about being someone others can count on. 
It's just that sometimes the weight becomes too  
much. Especially when people don't ask for help, 
and that's when fatigue turns into frustration.
So what helps? How do you deal with it? Talking 
like this helps. Being seen, being heard, resting  
without guilt, doing a small things that bring 
peace. For me, it's our conversations or watching  
a movie with your mom or going for a walk at 
night. I also write sometimes when I can't sleep,  
just putting thoughts down and also knowing I'm 
not alone. I'm not the only one who feels this  
way. I never knew. I just thought grown-ups were 
like robots. No, we're just kids who grew up and  
now have to pretend we've got it all figured 
out. But we don't. And that's okay. You know  
what really helps? When someone understands when 
someone like you asks questions instead of just  
ignoring the signs. That kind of thing gives me 
a second wine. It reminds me that I'm not just  
working to survive. I'm living for the people I 
love. You mean me? Especially you. When I grow up,  
I want to remember this. I don't want to be tired 
all the time. I want to find balance. I guess then  
that's already a step ahead of where most of us 
started. If you know that now you can build a life  
where you don't just function, you can thrive and 
maybe just maybe be a little less tired. Thanks,  
Dad. I think I understand a little better now. 
Anytime, son. And hey, if you ever see me looking  
tired, don't be afraid to give me a hug or remind 
me to rest. Sometimes that's all we really need.
All right, here are the seven key 
expressions from the conversation  
with meanings and examples to help you 
fully understand and use them. Number one,  
emotionally worn out. The meaning is to 
feel mentally and emotionally exhausted,  
usually after stress or difficult situations. 
For example, after months of dealing with his  
parents' divorce, he felt emotionally worn 
out. Example number two, teachers are often  
emotionally worn out by the end of the school 
year. Now, repeat after me. Emotionally worn out.
emotionally worn out.
Number two, running on fumes. The meaning 
is to continue working or functioning even  
though you have very little energy left. 
For example, I haven't slept all night.  
I'm running on fumes today. Example 
number two. After working three jobs,  
she was just running on fumes every day. 
Now repeat after me. Running on fumes.
Running on fumes.
Number three, survival mode. The meaning is a 
state where a person is only focused on basic  
daily needs and getting through the day, often 
under stress. For example, after losing his job,  
he lived in survival mode for months. 
Example number two, single parents are  
often in survival mode, trying to do everything 
alone. Now repeat after me. Survival mode.
Survival mode.
Number four, burnt out. The meaning 
is to be extremely tired or exhausted,  
especially due to too much work or stress. For 
example, I was so burned out after finals week  
that I slept for 12 hours straight. 
Example number two. She quit her job  
because she was completely burned out. Now 
repeat after me. Burnt out. Burned out.
Number five. Disconnected from joy. The meaning 
is to lose the ability to feel happiness or  
enjoyment in life. For example, he used to love 
music but now he feels disconnected from joy.  
Example number two. When you are too busy, 
it's easy to become disconnected from joy.  
Now repeat after me. Disconnected from joy.
Disconnected from joy.
Number six, fatigue turns into frustration. 
The meaning is when tiredness is not managed,  
it leads to anger, irritation or sadness. For 
example, after weeks of working late, his fatigue  
turned into frustration with everything. Example 
number two. If you don't rest, fatigue turns into  
frustration and affects your relationships. Now 
repeat after me. Fatigue turns into frustration.
Fatigue turns into frustration.
Number seven, a second wine. The meaning 
is a sudden burst of energy or motivation  
after feeling tired. For example, after dinner,  
I got a second wine and cleaned the whole 
house. Example number two. Hearing the good  
news, gave her a second wine to finish the 
project. Now repeat after me. A second wine.
A second wine.
Well done. Now, shadowing section. 
Repeat each phrase after a short pulse,  
trying to match the rhythm, pronunciation, 
and intonation. Do this two to three times  
for each sentence to train your mouth and ears 
in real English flow. And not just physically.  
A lot of utles walk around every 
day feeling emotionally worn out.
Some days I feel like I'm just running on fumes.
I try to stay positive, but there are 
days I feel like I'm in survival mode.
That's why so many people feel burned out. They 
are doing too much and getting too little back.
Sometimes they become disconnected from joy 
and that's when life starts to feel empty.
And that's when fatigue turns into frustration
instead of just ignoring the signs. That 
kind of thing gives me a second wine.
Excellent. Now you will answer three 
questions about the conversation.  
You will be given some seconds to answer the 
question and then I will give you the answer.  
I recommend you to repeat the conversation part 
again before you go to this section. Remember  
these questions are comprehension questions and 
sometimes there is not an exact answer but the  
main idea. Let's start. Question number one. Why 
does Liam ask his dad why adults are always tired?
The answer is because he notices 
that his dad, his mom, his teachers,  
and even strangers all look exhausted, and 
he wants to understand why. Question number  
two. What does Tom say is one of the main 
reasons adults feel tired all the time?
The answer is he says adults carry 
many responsibilities like work, bills,  
stress and family problems and don't often rest 
which leads to physical and emotional exhaustion.  
Question number three. What helps Tom deal with 
the tiredness and the stress of adult life?
The answer is talking with loved ones, 
taking quiet moments, writing his thoughts,  
and remembering his working for the people he 
loves, especially his son. Give him a strength  
and a second wine. And that's the end of 
today's lesson, my friends. We explored  
an emotional and real conversation about why 
adults often feel tired. And through this story,  
you learned seven new useful phrases that can help 
you speak English more naturally and deeply. Now,  
it's your turn. Have you ever felt 
worn out or disconnected from joy?  
What do you do to get a second wine? 
Let me know in the comments below.
Hello. Good morning. Are you 
Mr. Harry, the career advisor?
Yes. Good morning. You must be 
Santiago, right? Nice to meet you.
Yes, that's me. Thank you for 
meeting with me. I really need help.  
I'm applying for a job in a very 
important company and they asked me to
to send my resume, but I don't 
know how to do it the right way.
No problem, Santiago. That's exactly 
why I'm here. Many people feel the same.
A resume or CV is something very 
important and if you don't do it well,
you can lose a big opportunity. But don't worry,  
I'll help you step by step. We'll make it clear, 
professional, and perfect for the job you want.
Great. Thank you so much. So, where do we start?
All right. Let's begin with a 
simple question. What is a resume?
A resume is like your personal 
advertisement. It's a paper or digital file
that tells a company, hey, this is 
who I am. This is what I can do and  
this is why you should hire me. So, it 
has to be clean, short, professional,
and honest. No lies, just your 
best version. Very important.
Wow, I didn't think of it like that. 
So, what should I put in the resume?
Okay, a good resume usually has 
these main parts. Pay attention.
Contact information. Professional 
summary or objective,
work experience, education, skills, languages,
other like certifications or 
volunteer work. Let's go one by one.
Number one, contact information. This 
goes at the top. Put your full name,  
phone number, email address, and sometimes 
your LinkedIn profile if you have one.
You don't need to put your age, photo, 
or full address. Just the city is fine.  
Really? I thought I had to 
put my birthday and photo.
Well, it depends. Some companies 
require that information, but
in most modern companies, they don't 
want photos or personal details like
age, religion, or marital status. 
That information is private
and it's not related to your skills. Number 
two, professional summary or objective. This  
is a short paragraph at the top. 
Two or three lines. That's enough.
You tell the company who you are 
and what you want. For example,
motivated young professional with 
experience in customer service
looking for a position in a dynamic 
company to grow and contribute
with a strong communication skills. That 
is something you can put on your CV.
It's like a short introduction. 
Keep it simple, positive, and clear.
Oh, okay. So, one question. I 
don't talk about my life here.
Exactly. No life story, just 
your career focus. Number three,  
work experience. All right, this is the heart 
of your resume. You list your previous jobs,
but always start with the most 
recent one. Write the job title,
the company name, the dates you worked there,
and three or four bullet points 
of what you did. For example,
sales assistant supermarket 
SA January 2021 to June 2023.
helped customers find products, 
managed the cash register,
kept the store clean and organized, 
promoted new offers and discounts.
Oh, interesting. And what if 
I don't have much experience?
Then you can talk about volunteer 
work, internships or projects.
Even helping in your family business 
counts if it shows responsibility.
Number four, education. Again, 
start with the most recent,  
right? The name of the school or 
university, the title or degree,
the year of graduation or in 
progress if you are still studying.
No need to write your grades or subjects 
unless they are very important for the job.
I understand. And do I need 
to include high school or not?
High school. Um, yes. If you 
don't have university studies yet,
but if you finished college, high 
school is not very important.
Number five, skills. This is a short 
list of things you can do well.  
Use simple words and separate 
them with commas. For example,
teamwork, communication, Microsoft Excel, 
social media, customer service. But remember,  
only include skills you really have. Don't lie.
So, I shouldn't say Photoshop if I 
only used it once, right? Correct.  
Be honest. In the interview, they 
might ask you to show your skills.
Number six, languages. This part is optional but 
very useful. You can write English intermediate,  
Spanish native, Portuguese basic. Be realistic. 
If you say advanced English, but you can't have a  
conversation, it looks bad in the interview. 
You have to be very careful with that.
Number seven, other information. 
This can be courses, certificates,  
workshops, or volunteer work 
that adds value. For example,
first ed courts red cross 2022 
volunteer animal shelter 2023.
But remember, if it's not related 
to the job, you can skip it.
Excellent. But what are the most common 
mistakes uh people make in their CVs?
Great question. Well, here are a few. Making it  
too long. No one wants to read five 
pages. One or two pages is enough.
Using bad formatting, very common. Use 
a clean font like Ariel or Calivary.
Writing in paragraphs, bullet 
points are easier to read. Remember,
grammar mistakes. Always check your 
spelling. Ask someone to review it.  
adding unnecessary info. No need to talk 
about your hobbies. I love watching TV.
Use the same CV for every job. You 
should always adjust your resume
depending on the job you're applying 
for. Those are the most common mistakes.
I think I made most of 
those mistakes in my old CV.
Don't worry, now you know better. Good 
luck, Santiago. I believe in you. If

Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode 
of Tangerine Academy. Today's lesson is all  
about a super important question that I get all 
the time from my students. How do you practice  
your English in a way that actually works? Not 
just the same old advice like talk to yourself  
in the mirror or write your daily routine. No, no, 
we're going deeper. Today, I sat down with three  
of my students to hear their real experiences, 
what didn't work for them, and more importantly,  
what finally did. Each one shares a unique and 
modern technique that truly helped them improve.  
And you're going to learn a lot from what they 
went through. Plus, we'll highlight seven powerful  
expressions and vocabulary words that can help 
you express yourself better in daily English.  
So sit back, relax, and listen carefully 
because this conversation might be exactly  
what you need to take your English 
to the next level. Let's get started.
All right, class. Today I want to do something 
different. Instead of me giving you tips, I want  
to hear from you. Let's be honest, we've all tried 
things that didn't work. I want you to share one  
method you tried to improve your English that 
didn't help and then share the one that finally  
made the difference. Let's inspire each other. All 
right, let's start with you, Alex. Thanks teacher.  
Well, I used to force myself to read articles 
from big newspapers like the New York Times or  
the Guardian every morning. I thought it will help 
me get better at English, especially vocabulary,  
but honestly, it didn't work for me. The text were 
too advanced. I didn't understand a lot of words  
and I ended up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. 
It wasn't enjoyable and I stopped doing it after  
a few weeks. What finally helped me was something 
very different and unexpected. I started following  
Englishspeaking Reddit communities that talk 
about topics I love like gaming and movies. I  
know it sounds funny, but reading and responding 
to real comments, jokes, opinions, arguments,  
it made me feel I was part of the conversation. 
It wasn't perfect English, but it was authentic  
and relatable. I learned real phrases like, "That 
movie totally flopped." Or, "He nailed the role."  
Those are expressions I never saw in textbooks. 
Reading Reddit taught me how people actually talk,  
and it helped me write better, too. Now I even 
comment and reply in English. And when someone  
answers me back, it feels like I'm really 
communicating. That gave me confidence.
That's a great example, Alex. It shows 
that finding content that is engaging  
and contextualized makes a big difference. The 
phrase you use, I felt frustrated and overwhelmed,  
is something a lot of learners experience. But 
I love how you found a way to turn your interest  
into practice. Reddit is actually a fantastic 
tool if used wisely. Well done. Okay, now Matio,  
it's your turn. Thank you. For me, at first I was 
obsessed with vocabulary, flashcards. I downloaded  
all the apps, Anki, Quizlet, Memorize, you name 
it. I could have studied words like allocate,  
resilient, or comprehensive. But I realized 
something. I was learning words, not language.  
I couldn't use them naturally. I could forget 
the words after a few days because I didn't  
know how or when to use them. It felt empty. 
I was memorizing for the sake of memorizing.  
What finally helped me was creating what I call a 
personal English portfolio. Basically, I started  
collecting real sentences and short text from TV 
shows, YouTube interviews, and real conversations.  
Only things that I found interesting. I created 
a Google doc and organized it by topics, health,  
love, work, emotions. I could copy the sentence, 
translate it, and then try to create a similar one  
that related to my life. For example, I learned 
the phrase to hit rock bottom from a documentary.  
It meant to reach your lowest point in life. 
That phrase spoke to me. I wrote, "I hit  
rock bottom last year when I lost my job." That 
phrase is stuck in my memory forever because it  
was connected to my life. I also started recording 
audio summaries of my week using some of those new  
phrases. Now I can talk about topics like burnout, 
failure, dreams, and motivation with more depth.
Wow, that's brilliant. A personal English 
portfolio. I might start recommending that to  
other students. It's active learning and it's 
personal, so it sticks. I also love how you  
turned passive listening into a practical tool by 
reusing language in your own context. All right,  
now let's hear from Louis. Hi everyone. So, my 
old method was kind of funny. I I used to memorize  
scripts from movies. I could literally write down 
the scenes and act them out in front of a mirror.  
It made me feel cool like an actor, but it didn't 
help much with real conversations. I knew lines,  
but not how to respond. spontaneously. I felt 
like I was performing, not communicating.  
What really helped me improve was something my 
cousin told me. He lives in Australia. He said,  
"Why don't you join online communities 
that practice English through roleplay?"  
At first, I didn't understand what he meant, but 
then I joined a Discord group where people meet  
in voice chat and pretend to be characters 
in different scenarios, business meetings,  
casual conversations, interviews, even fantasy 
role plays. It was amazing because I had to speak,  
not just repeat. I had to think, react, answer, 
and build the stories on the spot. For example,  
we had a session called airport roleplay. I had 
to act like a traveler with a problem and another  
student was the airport staff. I had to explain 
my issue, ask for help, and stay calm. It taught  
me phrases like, "I'd like to file a complaint," 
or, "There must be some misunderstanding." It felt  
scary at first. But that pressure to respond 
in real time made me improve quickly. Plus,  
it was fun and full of louder. That's incredible, 
Louis. You touched on something very important.  
Language comes alive when you use it in realtime 
situations. These role-play groups are a  
fantastic way to build confidence and fluency. I 
especially liked the expressions you mentioned,  
file a complaint, some misunderstanding. 
Those are very useful in daily life.  
All right, here are the seven key expressions from 
the conversation with meanings and examples to  
help you fully understand and use them. Number 
one, frustrated and overwhelmed. The meaning  
of this is feeling emotionally tired or hopeless 
because something is too difficult or confusing.  
For example, I felt frustrated and overwhelmed 
when I couldn't understand native speakers.
Example number two. She was 
overwhelmed by the amount of  
grammar she had to learn. Now repeat after 
me. Frustrated and overwhelmed. frustrated
and overwhelmed.
Number two, authentic and relatable. 
The meaning is something real and easy  
to connect with emotionally. For example, 
I prefer learning from authentic English,  
not textbooks. Example number two. 
His story was so relatable. I felt the  
same when I moved to another country. Now 
repeat after me. Authentic and relatable.
authentic and relatable.
Number three, to hit rock bottom. 
The meaning is to reach the lowest  
most difficult point in a situation. 
For example, he hit rock bottom after  
losing his job and breaking up with his 
girlfriend. Example number two. Sometimes  
hitting rock bottom helps us start over. 
Now repeat after me. To hit rock bottom.
To hit rock bottom.
Number four. Personal English portfolio. The 
meaning is a custom collection of English phrases,  
notes, and reflections created 
by a learner. For example,  
I built a personal English portfolio with 
real life phrases from Netflix shows.  
Example number two, her English improved a lot 
thanks to her vocabulary notebook and portfolio.
Now repeat after me. Personal English portfolio.
Personal English portfolio.
Number five, to file a complaint. The meaning 
is to officially report a problem, especially in  
services. For example, I filed a complaint because 
the hotel room was dirty. Example number two,  
you can file a complaint at the customer service 
desk. Now repeat after me. To file a complaint.
To file a complaint.
Number six, there must be some misunderstanding. 
The meaning is a polite way to say that something  
is wrong or confused. For example, sorry, there 
must be some misunderstanding. I booked this room  
first. Example number two. She thought I was 
angry, but there was just a misunderstanding.
Now repeat after me. There 
must be some misunderstanding.
There must be some misunderstanding.
Number seven, pressure to respond in real time. 
The meaning is the challenge of thinking and  
speaking quickly during a conversation. For 
example, speaking with native speakers gives  
me pressure to respond in real time. Example 
number two. That pressure helped me get more  
fluent and confident. Now repeat after 
me. Pressure to respond in real time.
pressure to respond in real time.
Well done. Now, shadowing section. 
Repeat each phrase after a short pulse,  
trying to match the rhythm, 
pronunciation, and intonation.  
Do this two to three times for each sentence 
to train your mouth and ears in real English  
flow. I didn't understand a lot of words and 
I ended up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed.
It wasn't perfect English, but 
it was authentic and relatable.
For example, I learned the phrase to 
hit rock bottom from a documentary.
What finally helped me was creating what 
I call a personal English portfolio.
It taught me phrases like, "I'd 
like to file a complaint or
There must be some misunderstanding.
It felt scary at first, but that pressure to 
respond in real time made me improve quickly.
Excellent. Now you will answer three questions 
about the conversation. You will be given some  
seconds to answer the question and then 
I will give you the answer. I recommend  
you to repeat the conversation part again 
before you go to this section. Remember  
these questions are comprehension questions and 
sometimes there is not an exact answer but the  
main idea. Let's start. Question number one. 
What method helped Alex improve his English?
The answer is he started reading and replying 
to comments on Reddit communities about his  
interests which helped him learn real and 
authentic English. Question number two,  
what is a personal English 
portfolio and who created it?
The answer is Matio created it. It's a document 
where he collects real life phrases and examples  
from English media, organizes them by topic, 
and practices them with personal sentences.
Question number three, why did Louis 
prefer English roleplay groups?
The answer is because they helped 
him practice spontaneous speaking and  
react in real time. It was fun and gave him 
real experience with natural conversation.
So now you've learned three creative and modern 
ways to practice English and you've heard real  
stories from real students. Now it's your 
turn. What's one method that worked for you  
or one that didn't? Write it in the comments. 
I'd love to read your stories. And don't forget  
to practice shadowing the dialogue and review 
the vocabulary. That's how you make English  
part of your life. Subscribe if you found this

English to communicate. You need real English 
used with confidence. See you in the next video.
Hey everyone, welcome back to Everyday 
English with Tangerine Academy,  
your space to learn English naturally through 
real life conversations. In today's episode,  
we're going shopping at a local mini 
market with two characters, Mr. James,  
a friendly man buying groceries for 
the week, and Marco, the store owner.  
But this isn't just about buying bread and milk. 
We'll hear daily vocabulary, polite expressions,  
persuasive phrases, and natural small talk. 
And pay close attention. We'll also learn seven  
useful phrases that are a bit more advanced, 
but super helpful in daily conversations.  
So, grab your notebook, get ready to listen, 
learn, and laugh, and let's head to the store.
Hey there, Mr. James. Long time no see you. How 
have you been? Hey, Marco. I've been all right.  
Just super busy lately. Work, errands, family, 
you know the deal. And today I realized my fridge  
looks like a desert. Nothing but a half lemon 
and expired yogurt. That sounds rough. Well,  
you came to the right place. What can I help you 
with today? Let's see. I need eggs, some fresh  
bread, onions, tomatoes, and do you have that 
honey you sold me last time? The one from the  
countryside? Oh, yes, the locally sourced honey. 
You've got good taste. That one's from a small  
farm just outside the city. It's 100% organic and 
unprocessed. Perfect. I'll take a jar. And hey,  
how much are the eggs today? A dozen for 350. They 
are farm fresh. [Music] Last week they were 280,  
weren't they? Yeah. Well, prices went up from 
the supplier. But hey, how about I throw in a  
small bunch of parsley for free. It's fresh from 
this morning. You drive a hard game, Marco. But  
all right, that works. I appreciate it. That's the 
spirit. Now, I've got these new lobs of sourdough  
bread straight out of the oven this morning. Want 
to try one? Wow, smells amazing. Yeah, I'll grab  
one. I might even eat half of it on the way home. 
You wouldn't be the first. And how are things  
going otherwise? You look a bit tired today. Yeah, 
life's been a little hectic lately. Deadlines,  
bills, helping the kids with homework. Honestly, 
just walking into this shops feels like a break.  
You know what they say, a full pantry brings peace 
of mind. It's good to slow down, even if it's just  
while picking out tomatoes. Speaking of which, 
these tomatoes look good. Are they on sale? They  
are part of our weekend promo. Buy2 and the third 
one free. Nice. That's a good incentive to cook  
tonight instead of ordering in again. Exactly. And 
if you want to add something new to your meals,  
I've got some spice blends that are flying 
off the shelves. Just arrived from a supplier  
who works with Peruvian herbs. Interesting. 
You're always updating the shop. You know,  
that's one thing I've always admired about you. 
You keep things fresh and not just the food.  
Well, I try. In a small shop like this, customer 
service and variety make all the difference. Plus,  
I love chatting with people. Selling groceries 
is only part of what I do. I'm also a bit of a  
therapist. That's true. Honestly, coming 
here feels better than some cafe visits.  
You get food and good conversation and no shirts 
for the advice. By the way, how much is everything  
so far? All right, let's see. Bread, eggs, honey, 
tomatoes, and onions. That's $15.70 all together.  
I'll give you a small discount. Call it 1450. 
Thanks, Marco. Let me check my wallet. Um, I've  
got a 20. Can you break it? Of course. Here's your 
change. 550. And don't forget your parley. You are  
a legend. Hey, you ever think of expanding this 
place all the time? But expansion means more work.  
And right now, I kind of enjoy this space. Plus, 
I get to know my customers. There's something  
very wholesome about that. Wholesome, that's 
the word. Yeah, it feels like community here,  
not just shopping. That's the goal, my friend. All 
right, stay safe out there. And hey, don't wait  
until your fridge turns into a wasteland to come 
visit me next time. Deal. Thanks again, Marco.  
I'll see you soon. Anytime, James. Take care. All 
right. Here are the seven key expressions from  
the conversation with meanings and examples 
to help you fully understand and use them.  
Number one, locally sourced. The meaning 
is products that are grown or made close to  
where they are sold, usually supporting 
a small local producers. For example,  
I prefer to buy locally sourced vegetables from 
the farmers market. Example number two. That  
honey is locally sourced from a nearby mountain 
farm. Now repeat after me. Locally sourced.
Locally sourced.
Number two, straight out of the oven. The meaning 
is something freshly baked or cooked just taken  
out of the oven. For example, these cookies are 
straight out of the oven. Try one while they  
are warm. Example number two. The smell of bread 
straight out of the oven is always so comforting.  
Now repeat after me. Straight out of 
the oven. Straight out of the oven.
Number three, hectic. The meaning is very 
busy, fastpaced, or full of pressure and chaos.  
For example, my week has been so hectic, I 
barely had time to eat. Example number two.  
December is a hectic month at work with all the 
deadlines. Now repeat after me. Hectic. Hectic.
Number four, incentive. The meaning is a reason 
or reward that encourages someone to do something.  
For example, offering a discount is a great 
incentive to attract new customers. Example  
number two, the gym gives a free shirt as an 
incentive to join. Now repeat after me. Incentive.
Incentive.
Number five, flying off the shelves. 
The meaning is selling very quickly  
due to high demand. For example, that 
new snack is flying off the shelves.  
Everyone wants to try it. Example 
number two. These handmade soaps are  
flying off the shelves at the market. Now 
repeat after me. Flying off the shelves.
Flying off the shelves.
Number six. Wholesome. The meaning is good 
for you emotionally, mentally or physically,  
sincere and pure. For example, a family dinner on 
Sundays feels so wholesome. Example number two.  
That video of the grandma baking with her grandson 
was so wholesome. Now repeat after me. Wholesome.
Wholesome.
Number seven. You drive a hard bargain. 
The meaning is an expression used when  
someone negotiates firmly or gets 
a very good deal for themselves.  
For example, you drive a hard bargain, but okay, 
I'll take your offer. Example number two. She  
drove a hard bargain, but I finally agreed. 
Now repeat after me. You drive a hard bargain.
You drive a hard bargain.
Well done. Now, shadowing section. Repeat each 
phrase after a short pulse, trying to match the  
rhythm, pronunciation, and intonation. Do this 
two to three times for each sentence to train  
your mouth and ears in real English flow. Oh yes, 
the locally sourced honey. You've got good taste.
I've got these new lobs of sourdough bread 
straight out of the oven this morning.
Yeah, life's been a little hectic lately. 
Deadlines, bills, helping the kids with homework.
Nice. That's a good incentive to cook 
tonight instead of ordering in again.
I've got some spice blends that 
are flying off the shelves.
Plus, I get to know my customers. There 
is something very wholesome about that.
You drive a hard parade, Marco. But 
all right, that works. I appreciate it.
Excellent. Now you will answer three questions 
about the conversation. You will be given some  
seconds to answer the question and then I will 
give you the answer. I recommend you to repeat  
the conversation part again before you go 
to this section. Remember these questions  
are comprehension questions and sometimes 
there is not an exact answer but the main  
idea. Let's start. Question number one. 
Why did James visit Marcos store that day?
The answer is James visited Marcos's 
store because he had no food left at  
home. He mentioned his fridge was 
empty and since he wanted to cook  
for himself instead of ordering food, he 
decided to stop by the local mini market.  
Question number two, what special 
offer did Marco give James on tomatoes?
The answer is Marco told James there was a limited 
time offer on tomatoes. Buy two pounds and get the  
third pound for free. This was a promotion 
to help customers and encourage more sales.
Question number three, what does 
James admire about Marcos mini market?
The answer is James said he liked how 
Marcus' store always had something fresh,  
not just in terms of food, but also in atmosphere 
and customer experience. He appreciated the  
warm local feel of the shop and how Marco 
keeps things creative and community-based.
Great job. Today you practiced English with a 
real life situation, shopping at a local store,  
and having a meaningful conversation while doing 
it. You learned seven useful and real vocabulary  
phrases. Practice shadowing with native style 
rhythm and improve your listening skills with  
comprehension questions. Don't forget, practice 
speaking these phrases out loud. Write a comment  
using one or more new words. Share this 
video with a friend who loves learning  
English like you do. And always remember, 
you don't need to speak perfect English.  
You just need to speak. Thanks for watching 
Tangerine Academy. See you next time.
Hey, Rodrigo. Do you have a moment? I 
need to ask you something important.
Sure, Sam. What's up? You don't 
look good, man. What happened?
I wanted to ask you something. I 
know it's kind of personal, but
Oh, this is embarrassing. Sorry, 
but can you lend me some money?
Lend you money? I don't know. 
What do you need it for?
Well, I really want to buy a new car. My old 
car is already falling apart. It's noisy,  
slow, and sometimes it doesn't 
even start. I need to change it.  
I've been thinking about this for a long 
time and I found one that I really like.
But there is one big problem. I 
don't have enough money for that.
Oh, I see. But Sam, this isn't the first 
time you ask for a loan, right? Yeah,  
I know. I hate asking, but you know 
how it is. I work, I save a little,  
and then something unexpected happens, 
and boom, my money disappears.
I understand life is expensive, but 
maybe instead of borrowing money again,  
you should think about how to 
make extra money. Don't you think,
Rodrigo? Don't you think I've 
tried? I watched videos, read blogs,
and everyone says the same thing. 
Save money, buy and sell things,
teach something online, open 
a business. It sounds easy,
but in real life, it's not. I even tried 
betting once, lost more than I won. Yeah,  
I get it. It's true. Online advice sounds 
so easy, but real life is different.
But listen, I'm not going to 
give you those same tips again.
I've actually tried a few things. 
myself and some of my friends have to
and I can tell some ideas really work. 
You just have to be smart and consistent.
Really? Like what? I'm tired of 
hearing the same recycled advice.
Okay, let me give you some real 
examples. First one, skill swapping.
One of my friends is great at fixing 
phones. I helped him set up a small  
Instagram page. He started offering phone 
repair for cheap. But here's the smart part.
He started offering to swap services, too. 
For example, he fixed a designer's phone
and the designer made him a cool 
logo and flyers. He didn't use money,
just traded skills. In a few months, 
he was getting paying customers.
Hm. That's interesting. So, no big investment. 
That's cool. Exactly. It was low risk. Now,  
he fixes five to six phones a week after work. 
Not millions, but it helps a lot. Another idea,  
renting things you don't use. I had a 
camera I never used. Instead of selling it,  
I started renting it to people. People who 
wanted to make videos or take photos. Just  
$10 a day. Sounds small, but it adds up. In 
one month, I made 200 just with that camera.
Wait, people really rent that stuff? Wow, 
that's impressive. I didn't know that.
Absolutely. Especially now with 
content creators everywhere.
You can rent cameras, tripods, lighting, 
even costumes, whatever you have.
Oh, another friend rents out 
party decorations from her garage.
People don't want to buy stuff for 
just one event. They want to borrow.
Man, I never thought about that. 
I have some old tools at home.
Maybe I could rent those to neighbors. 
I think that is an interesting idea.
That's a spirit. Now, here's another. 
Use your job to find opportunities.
I don't mean anything illegal or weird. 
I mean observe the problems people have.
at our office. Remember how the 
computers were super slow last year?
Yes, it was a nightmare. 
Happily, they are better now.
So, I took a free course online about 
cleaning and upgrading computers. Then,  
I offer to help some co-workers for 
$20 each. I cleaned their systems,  
removed junk files, installed 
antivirus. I made 180 in one week.
That's genius. You're not just 
working, you're um watching,
learning, and using what you see. 
That's very smart. Well done.
Exactly. Another tip, combine 
small things. For example,  
do a small service online while you watch TV 
or use cashback apps for things you already buy
or sell digital notes from online 
courses you already finished.
It's not big money. But when you 
combine these things, it adds up.
Yeah. You know, I always ignore 
service because they pay so little.
Sure. But if you do 10 of them during 
your free time, that's 10 or $15 a day.
That's 300 a month for just clicking 
buttons while sitting on the couch.
True. I guess I've been waiting 
for big money to come all at once.
That's the trap. We all wait for the 
big fish and ignore the small ones.  
But a small fish hit you every day. 
And I'm going to tell you something.
One day, if you are consistent, 
the big fish arrives. Believe me.
Man, I needed this talk. I've been 
in a loop. Spend, borrow, repeat.
I know. I've been there, too. But the key is 
not to wait for some perfect business idea.
Just start with something 
small, low risk, and repeatable.
Try three things at the same time. 
If one fails, you still have two.
Okay, I'm going to sit down this weekend 
and make a list of things I can rent,
things I know how to do, and maybe 
even start offering something at work.
And remember, don't tell yourself it's too 
little. A drop every day fills the glass.
Wow. Thanks, Rodrigo. I didn't 
expect to have this conversation.
You didn't give me money, but you 
gave me something better, a plan.
And that plan might just get you the 
car you want without that this time.
I hope so. And maybe next time 
I'll be the one giving you advice.
That's the goal. Let's make money the smart way,  
bro. If you could improve your English 
a little more, please subscribe to the  
channel and share this video with a friend. 
Thank you very much for your support.
Hey man, are you okay? You've been 
so quiet today. You barely touched  
your coffee. Something's going on. What happened?
She broke up with me, Ben, last night 
just like that. I still can't believe it.  
We were together for almost a year and now it's 
over. I keep asking myself what I did wrong. Wait,  
what? Are you serious? What did she say? Did you 
guys fight or something? Not really a big fight.  
She just said she wasn't happy anymore. She 
said I wasn't present in the relationship,  
that I spent too much time on my phone, that I was 
always online liking posts, replying to stories,  
texting people. She felt like I wasn't 
with her even when we were together.  
And yeah, she mentioned she was uncomfortable, 
that I liked photos of other girls, but come on,  
it's just Instagram. I never cheated. I never 
even flirted with anyone. I was just scrolling,  
double tapping like anyone else does. Wow. That's 
tough. But wait, do you really think she broke up  
with you just because of the phone? I think the 
phone was part of it. She also said I didn't look  
at her the way I used to. That when we were on 
dates, I was um distracted. She said something  
that really stuck with me. She said, "You talk 
more to your phone than me." And maybe maybe  
she's right. I mean, even when we were having 
dinner, sometimes I'd check a message or look  
at something funny online. I didn't think it was a 
big deal at the time. I thought I was just sharing  
stuff with her, but she saw it differently. 
She said I was emotionally unavailable.
Man, that hits hard. I get it though. It's 
so easy to just fall into the phone trap.  
You pick it up for one thing and suddenly 
you're lost in notifications, messages,  
reals, everything. Honestly, it's happened to 
me, too. Last year, Laura and I had this big  
argument because I missed something important. 
She said she was talking about her mom being  
sick and I was replying to a me sent. She got 
so mad. I told her I didn't mean to ignore her,  
but the damage was done. Exactly. That's the 
thing. We don't even realize we're hurting  
them because we don't mean to. We're just used to 
this constant phone world. Like sometimes I open  
Instagram and forget why I even open it in the 
first place. It's automatic now. And I feel so  
guilty because I really loved her. I still do. But 
I let a screen come between us. A stupid scream.
You're not the only one, bro. It's become 
normal now. People go to dinner and don't  
talk. They both scroll. Couples lie in bed 
facing opposite sides. Both checking Tik  
Tok. We say we are spending time together, but are 
we really? I mean, I remember when we were kids,  
we didn't have this. We played, talked, 
looked each other in the eye. Now,  
it's like the phone has become the 
third person in every relationship.
It's scary, right? And at the same time, 
I don't know how to live without it.  
The phone connects us. I met her on 
Instagram. Remember? We started talking  
in DMS. We shared songs, mammoths, talked 
late at night through voice notes. It was  
sweet in the beginning. The phone brought 
us together and now it pushed us apart.
That's the paradox, man. Phones can build love and 
destroy it. I've seen both. One of my co-workers  
told me his girlfriend moved to Spain last year 
and they stayed strong through video calls, text,  
photos. The phone kept them connected through 
distance. They are actually engaged now. But  
then there's my cousin. He broke up with his 
girlfriend after 3 years. Why? She found out  
he was talking with another girl on Snapchat. Just 
talking, nothing more. But that digital betrayal  
was enough for her. Yeah, I've heard a lot of 
stories like that. The line is so thin now.  
What is cheating really? Is it only physical or 
can I like a message, an emoji become emotional  
cheating? Great question and it depends on the 
person. Some people are cool with it. Others get  
really hard. The problem is we don't talk about 
it. We assume and we think it's okay because  
everyone does it. But maybe that's the problem. 
We all do it and no one sees it as harmful until  
the damage is already done. You know, the more we 
talk about this, the more I realize how phones are  
like a mirror. They show what we want to see. They 
give us what we want to hear and they make us feel  
like we are not alone, but at the same time, they 
take us away from people who are actually with us.  
I don't think phones are the problem really. It's 
how we use them. Exactly. And I didn't use mind  
in a bad way. At least not on purpose. I never 
cheated. I never hid anything from her. But still,  
she felt like she came second place. 
And that's a horrible feeling. You know,  
imagine being in a room with someone you love 
and feeling like you don't matter. That's how  
she described it to me. And I just sat there 
holding my phone. That's so real. I think a  
lot of people feel that but don't say it. They 
just slowly get more distant. And the worst  
part is we think, "Oh, it's fine. I'm still 
here. We're still together." But deep down,  
we're losing connection, not the 
Wi-Fi connection, the human one.
That's a good line, man. We're 
losing the human connection.  
Maybe we should write that down and post 
it somewhere. But honestly, after she left,  
I looked at my phone and it just felt empty, 
like it didn't matter anymore. I kept waiting  
for a message from her. Nothing came. And then I 
thought maybe I've been using this thing to escape  
real feelings to avoid being uncomfortable 
or bored or quiet. That's what phones do,  
man. They feel every little silence. We don't 
allow ourselves to just sit and think anymore.  
If there's one second of nothing, boom, 
we open a screen. But in relationships,  
those quiet moments matter. That's where trust 
grows. That's where we feel each other. When  
you are just sitting together and being present, 
you don't need to talk. You just exist together.  
You're right. I think we've forgotten how 
to be bored together. How to sit in silence  
without checking notifications. You know 
what's funny? She once asked me to leave  
my phone in another room during dinner just 
one night. I told her that was ridiculous.  
Now I'd give anything for one more quiet dinner 
with her. Man, you really love her. I still do.  
And maybe I'll always love her. But I learned 
something important. Bones aren't just tools.  
They are habits. And habits can destroy the 
things we care about if we don't control them.  
I made my phone a priority, not her, even if 
I didn't realize it. That's a hard lesson,  
but one that a lot of us need to learn. You know, 
my brother and his girlfriend have this rule.  
When they are together, phones go in a drawer. 
They don't touch them unless it's urgent. They  
say it help them communicate better and actually 
enjoy each other's presence. That's amazing. Maybe  
we all need something like that. A system, some 
kind of digital boundaries. Yeah. like no phones  
at the table or leaving the phone outside the 
bedroom or using apps to limit the screen time.  
I tried one last week. It tells me how many 
times I unlock my phone. Want to guess? um 50
136 in one day. I was shocked. I don't 
even remember using it that much.
Wow, it's crazy. And then we say, I don't have 
time to talk or I don't have time for my partner.  
But we have time for reals and memes. We make 
time for distractions but not for real connection.  
Exactly. And the truth is phones are powerful. 
They can help us stay close or push us apart. It  
depends on us. I mean, look, my cousin met his 
boyfriend through a dating app. They start in  
chatting, had video calls and after a few months 
they met in person. Now they are living together.  
In that case the phone was the bridge between two 
people. Yeah, that's the beauty of it. Technology  
isn't the enemy. It's our choices, our discipline. 
If we are aware of the risk, we can protect what  
matters. You said something earlier that is stuck 
with me too. That phones brought you two together,  
but also pushed you apart. That's the story of our 
generation, man. Connection and disconnection in  
the same device. So what now? What should 
I do? I feel like I lost her. And worse,  
I feel like I lost myself a little. You start 
this small. You learn. You reflect. Maybe write  
her a letter. Not a message, not a DM, a real 
letter. Tell her how you feel, what you realized.  
Even if she doesn't come back, you'll know you 
tried. And more than that, you'll know you grew.  
That actually sounds like a good idea. A letter, 
something real, like our old lives. Thanks, man.  
I needed this talk more than I thought. 
Me, too. And hey, next time we hang out,  
let's do it without our phones. Deal. Let's bring 
back real talks like this one. Who knows, maybe  
we can start a movement. One hour a day, no phone. 
Let's start with 1 hour. Then maybe we'll remember  
how it feels to just be human. So, do phones 
ruin relationships? The answer is they can, but  
they don't have to. It depends on how we use them, 
how we choose to connect with the people we love.  
So maybe today, put your phone down, look 
someone in the eyes, talk, listen, be present,  
because real love doesn't need Wi-Fi. If you

Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode 
of English Talks with Real Teachers.
I'm Peter, your host, and today we 
have a really interesting topic.
I know many of you are struggling 
with this problem, so pay attention.
How to learn and remember new English 
words every day. Not just learn,
but remember them too. And for that 
I invited someone very special.
He's been teaching English for more 
than 17 years. Wow, that's good.
And he's helped thousands of 
students improve their vocabulary
and also confidence in English. 
Please welcome Mr. Park. How are you?
Hi, Peter. Thanks so much for the 
invitation. I'm really happy to be here
and yes, I love this topic. Vocabulary is 
a huge part of learning English and you  
know what I think many students don't 
realize how powerful it is. I mean,  
learning just a few new words 
every day can be very powerful.
Exactly. And you know, one of the most 
common questions I get from people is,
"How do I memorize English words 
and not forget them the next day?
So, I'm really glad we are talking about 
this. Before we dive in, let's start simple.  
Why is vocabulary so important and what's 
special about learning 10 new words a day?
That's a great question. Vocabulary is 
like the bricks of a house. Without words,  
you can't speak, you can't 
write, you can't understand.
So, learning new words gives you 
more tools to express yourself. Yeah.
Now, about learning 10 new words a day, 
you could say, "Oh, it sounds small,
but if you do that every day 
for one month, that's 300 words.
In a year, it's more than 
3,600. That's a huge vocabulary.
And the best part is you don't 
need to study for 4 hours.
Just maybe 20 to 30 minutes a day 
with the right technique. Wow,  
that sounds powerful. But I guess the problem is
that many people learn 10 new words 
today and tomorrow they forget nine.
That's the problem. I've seen 
this with so many students.
They write the words, repeat them 
many times, even use flashcards,
but then nothing. One day later, they 
forget everything. I know that. Yeah,  
that used to happen to me a lot 
when I studied French in school.
I've memorized words for 
the exam and then boom gone.
It happens to all of us. But the 
good news is there's a better way,  
a smarter way. We need to stop memorizing 
words alone. Sometimes that doesn't work.
So I recommend to start learning 
the words with phrases and context.
I will explain that to you. When we 
learn a word like create for example,
we can look at the meaning to 
make something new. Okay, great.
But if we only learn the word, we 
might forget it. But if we learn a  
phrase like, "I want to create my own 
business." Now it's different because
you're learning how to use the 
word. you see it in a real sentence,
in a real situation that helps your 
brain remember faster and longer.
So instead of just memorizing a list 
of words, we should use phrases.
Exactly. It's like this. Let me 
explain. Your brain is like a city.
If you put one word in the city with no 
roads, it's just sitting there. But when  
you put that word inside a sentence, it 
connects to ideas, emotions, grammar.
That's the road. Now your brain can 
travel to that word anytime you need it.
Great. Can you give us an example 
of how to do that with 10 new words?
Sure. Let's say today you learn 
10 new words. These 10 new words.
grow, plan, dream, goal, build, future, 
try, fail, learn, and success. Now,  
instead of just repeating the words, we 
create two or three sentences using them.
like I have a big dream for my future or
I want to build my own company. Even 
if I fail, I will learn and try again.
Now you have a little story. Your brain 
sees a picture, a feeling, not just a word.
That's brilliant. So, it's like creating a 
little movie in your head using those words.
Yes. That's why I always tell my 
students, don't just study words,
use them in real life. Write 
about your day using new words.
Speak to yourself. Create imaginary 
conversations. It works very well.  
Let me tell you something. I had a 
student named Carla. She always said,
"I study words, but I forget everything." 
So I ask her, "How do you study?
She said, "I just write the word 10 times." 
And I told her, "That doesn't work."
That doesn't work for long-term 
memory. So, we changed her method.
Now, she uses the word in her own life. 
She connects it with people she knows
or problems at work or situations 
in her country. After one month,  
she remembered almost all the words. 
That was amazing. She was so happy.
That's amazing. So, it's not just 
about repetition, it's about context.
I like it. So, teacher, here's a 
question students ask all the time.
How long do I need to remember a new word? Like
if I learn it today, will I remember it 
next week? Help me with that, please.
Great question. There's something 
called spaced repetition.
It means you need to see the word 
many times but not on the same day.
For example, day one, learn the word. 
Day two, review it again. Day four,  
use it in a conversation. Day seven, write 
it in a story. Every time you use it again,  
your brain says, "Oh, this word is important."
So, repetition, but in different ways, not 
just look at the words 50 times in one day.  
What are some mistakes people make 
when trying to memorize vocabulary?
Here are three big mistakes. Number 
one, only memorizing, never using.
Number two, learning lists of 
random words with no meaning.  
And number three, not reviewing the 
words later. If you learn um umbrella,
but never say it again, it disappears, 
your brain deletes it like trash.
So speak, write, repeat. That's 
the formula. Don't forget it.
Thank you so much teacher and 
to all our listeners remember
start small be consistent use what 
you learn and don't forget it. If  
you could improve your English a little 
more please subscribe to the channel  
and share this video with a friend. 
Thank you very much for your support.
I need to talk to both of you. 
It's not easy for me to say this,  
but I lost my job last week. The company's 
having problems and they let me go.
I've been looking for new jobs, 
but it's going to take some time.
For now, we have to live with 
less money. I am really sorry.
It's okay, Mark. We're a family. We're 
going to get through this together.
Don't worry. We don't need 
expensive things to be happy.
We have each other and that's 
what matters most. We'll be fine.
Wait, what? So, what does that 
mean? We can't go out to eat. We  
can't buy new stuff. No internet. 
What about my birthday next month?
You promised we're going to go to 
the amusement park. It's not fair.
I I know, Alex. I'm really sorry. 
I didn't want this to happen,
but we need to make some changes now. 
We have bills to pay. We need to we  
need to use money for important 
things. Food, rent, electricity.
The amusement park will have to 
wait, but it will be temporary.
But that's not fair. Everyone 
at the school has new phones,  
new shoes. They go to the mall all the 
time. I don't want to be the poor kid. No,
Alex, listen to your father. This is just 
temporary. Your dad is a hard worker.
He is going to find a job soon 
and we're going to be okay.
You don't need new things to be happy. 
You need to be strong, patient, and kind.
It is still sucks. I don't get it. 
Why do we have to live like this?
I don't like it. I don't want it. 
Why does it have to be like that?
Alex, wait. Oh, no. I thought he would understand.
Don't worry, he will understand. 
Just give him some time.
Hey, Alex. What's up? You look 
kind of sad today. What happened?
Hey, Leo. Yeah, things are not 
great at home. My dad lost his job.
Now we can't spend money. No video 
games, no trips, no nothing. I hate it,
man. I'm sorry to hear that, but 
honestly, I know how it feels.
My dad lost his job two years ago. 
He now works as a cleaner in a hotel.
It's not easy for us either, but 
sometimes those things happen in life.
Really? I didn't know that. 
But you always seem so happy.
Well, we don't have much, but we 
try to enjoy the little things like
we don't go to restaurants. 
We don't have cable TV. Um,
sometimes we eat just rice and 
eggs for dinner. But you know what?
We laugh, we play cards, we talk. My dad 
works super hard and I'm proud of him.
Wow. I guess I never thought 
about that. I complained because
we can't go to an amusement park, but 
at least I still have a warm house.
put every day a bed and my parents love me  
so exactly you know life is not 
about things it's about people
I know we all want more but when 
you lose something you start to be
what really matters. You still have 
your dad and he's doing his best,  
right? Yeah. He wakes up early 
and applies for jobs every day.
He's always tired, but still smiles 
at me. I think I should say thank you  
to him. That's a great idea, man. And maybe 
help him, too. Make him feel he's not alone.
Even a small thing like cleaning your room 
or helping with dinner can mean a lot.
You're right. I've been acting like 
a spoiled kid. Time to grow up a bit.
Hey, Dad. Can we talk for a minute? 
I need to tell you something.
Of course, son. You can talk to me 
whenever you want. What's on your mind?
I just I just wanted to say 
I'm sorry for being so selfish.
I didn't understand how hard things are for 
you. I talked to Leo today and his family has  
even less than we do, but he's still happy. I 
want to be more like that. Alex, thank you. I'm  
surprised. That means a lot to me. Seriously, 
I know this is hard, especially for you. It  
is hard. You're still young. But your mom and I 
love you so much. I want you to know that, son.
And we're doing everything we can 
to keep this family strong always.
I know. And I want to help. Maybe 
I can make breakfast sometimes or  
clean the dishes or just be a better 
son. I want to help this family too.
I am very happy. That's the best 
gift you can give us right now.  
your support, your love, 
your understanding. You know,
you've grown so much today, Alex. 
I'm proud of you, my dear son.
Now, why don't we eat something? A 
simple dinner. Rice, beans, and toast.
Okay, I like that. But next time, 
can we at least add some chicken?
Deal. As soon as I get a new job, 
you'll get chicken and dessert.
And until then, we have what we 
need, each other. We love you, son.

Hello, Tom. Nice to meet you. Please 
have a seat. I read your email.
You said you've saved a bit of money and 
want to know how to invest it, right?
Yes, Edward. Thank you for 
your time. I've been working
in the same company for over 10 
years. It's not a highpaying job,
but it's stable. Every month 
I save about 10% of my salary.
It was hard, believe me. But I 
managed to save around $5,000.
That's amazing, Tom. Many people don't even save  
$500. The fact that you save 5,000 shows you're 
serious about your future and responsible.
Thanks. But now I'm stuck. That money 
is just sitting in my bank account.
I don't want to waste it, but I 
don't want to take big risks either.
That's why I came to you. I want to learn. 
I want to learn how to invest my money. Of  
course. Let's talk about your options. 
First, I'll explain something simple.
Every investment has a level of risk. 
There are low risk, medium risk,
high risk investments. The higher the 
risk, the higher the possible return.
but also the higher the chance to lose money. 
So, we need to find the right balance for you.
That makes sense. I prefer something safe, 
but I'm also curious to hear all the options.
Perfect. Let's start with lowrisk options.  
These are good if you want to to protect your 
money, but the returns are small. For example,
you can open a high yield savings 
account, your money stays safe,
and you earn a little interest every 
month. That's how it works. Tom,
that sounds nice, but I already 
have a normal savings account.
The interest is almost nothing. What 
you're saying sounds interesting.
Yes, regular accounts pay very little, 
but high yield accounts pay more,
especially online banks. Still, 
it's true. The profit is small.
It's good for shortterm goals 
or emergency savings. Let's see.  
Another option is certificates of deposit CDS.
You lock your money in the bank 
for 6 months, one year or more.
During that time, you can't use the money, 
but the bank gives you better interest.
H I heard about that, but 
you know, my cousin tried it.
He said he needed the money during an 
emergency and couldn't take it out.
Yes, that's the downside. 
It's safe, but not flexible.
You need to be 100% sure you won't 
need the money during that time.
I don't think that's for me. I like 
having access to my money just in case.
Got it. Now let's look at medium risk 
investments. This give better returns
but there's a little more 
risk. A popular option is ETFs
exchange traded bonds. Basically, 
it's a group of stocks,
bonds you invest in together. It's like 
buying a basket of different companies.
Sounds interesting, but I don't 
know much about the stock market.
That's the good thing about ETFs. You 
don't have to choose the companies.
The fund already includes many 
good ones. Good companies.
So even if one company goes down, 
the others help balance the risk.
There are ETFs or tech, clean energy, 
health, or even the whole market.
Wow, that sounds more modern. 
Can I start with little money?
Yes, you can invest as little as 100 or $200.
Some apps even let you buy parts of an 
ETF. Don't need to buy the whole one.
It is a great way to start learning 
without using all your money.
I like that idea. But what else is there?
Okay, another medium risk option 
is real estate crowdfunding.
You don't need to buy a house. 
You can invest a small amount
like $500 into a project with 
other people. For example,
a new apartment. When the building makes 
money, you get a part of the profit.
Wait. Um, I can invest in real 
estate without buying a property.
Exactly. It's becoming 
popular. But be careful because
some platforms are not well regulated. 
You have to choose the company wisely.
Sounds good, but a little scary. 
What if the building fails?
That's why it's medium risk, you could 
lose some money. But if you study
and choose trusted platforms, it can 
be a smart way to grow your money.
Okay, I'll write that one down. 
What about high-risk options?
High-risk options can give big 
returns, but they are not for everyone.
One example is cryptocurrency. 
You've heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum?
Yes, I have a friend who made money with 
that and another one who lost everything.
Yes, that's exactly what 
happens. Crypto is very volatile.
One day it goes up 20%. The 
next day it goes down 40%.
If you invest in crypto, you must be ready 
to lose that money. Keep that in mind.
I don't like that. I worked too hard 
for my savings. I don't want to gamble.
wise decision. Crypto is not for 
everyone. Another high risk idea  
is individual stocks like buying shares 
in just one company Apple, Amazon, Tesla.
You can win big or lose big. It's 
not a stable. That's the thing.
Yeah, I don't want to put all my money 
in one place. That sounds dangerous.
Exactly. Most smart investors don't 
do that either. They diversify. They  
spread their money across different 
investments. Some save, some risky.
That sounds like a better plan. So, 
I could put part of my money in ETFs,  
part in high yield account, and maybe a 
small part in real estate crowdfunding.
Now, you're thinking like an investor.  
That's the strategy. Mix things up. Start 
small. Test one thing, learn how it works,  
and decide to add more later. Yeah, I like 
that. One step at a time. I don't want to rush,
you know? I just want my money 
to grow slowly and safely.
That's a smart mindset. And remember, investing 
is not magic. You don't become rich in one year,  
but with patience, you can build something great.  
Just like you saved this money with hard 
work, you can grow it with smart choices.
Thank you, Edward. You really opened my 
eyes. Really? I didn't know. There were  
so many options. I need to think 
about everything we talked about.
Absolutely. Never rush when it 
comes to money. Take your time.
And when you're ready, we can meet 
again and build a plan together.
Deal. I'll go home, do some 
research, maybe watch a few videos,  
and slip on it. If you could improve your 
English a little more, please subscribe

Hello, welcome back English learners
from all over the world. This is
Tangerine Academy. Have you ever gone
shopping for an important occasion?
Maybe a wedding, a big event, or your
very first day at a brand new job. Well,
in today's lesson, you're going to join
a Stevan as he shops for clothes after
being hired at a very important company.
He wants to look professional,
confident, but still be himself. In this
powerful and super useful conversation,
you will learn real shopping vocabulary.
Here seven advanced expressions used
naturally in context.
Understand the importance of appearance
and presence in work life.
Practice pronunciation with shadowing
and check your understanding with three
great questions. So get ready, get
stylish. Let's go shopping in English.
Good afternoon sir. Welcome to style. Is
there anything specific you're looking
for today?
Yeah, actually I just got hired for a
new job and I want to get some clothes
that will help me look more well
professional. It's kind of a big deal
for me.
Congratulations.
That's amazing news. What kind of
company is it?
It's a tech startup, a small but fast
growing. I'll be leading a project team.
They liked my portfolio and offered me
the job last week. To be honest, I'm
still a bit surprised.
I want to make a good impression, you
know.
Absolutely. And first impressions are
everything.
When you walk into a room, your outfit
speaks before you even say a word. And
in business, that can make or break a
connection.
See, I've always been kind of uh casual.
I want to look good, of course, but
nothing flashy. I like to keep things
lowkey.
Of course, we can find something that
says confident without shouting.
Remember, style is a language and the
goal is to send the right message.
Respect, intelligence,
reliability.
Yeah, I've never thought of clothes like
that. I usually wear what's comfortable.
Let me show you some basics. A well
fitted navy blazer, for instance, is
extremely versatile.
You can wear it with dress pants
or even jeans on casual Fridays. We're
building a wardrobe that works for you,
not just one that looks nice.
That sounds good. I want to keep it
simple, like clean lines, solid colors,
nothing that feels pretentious.
I hear you and you're right to avoid
anything too showy.
But don't confuse confidence with
arrogance. Looking sharp isn't
pretentious.
It's intentional.
It tells people you care about the job,
about yourself, and about the people
you'll work with.
That actually makes a lot of sense. I
never wanted to stand out too much, but
I get that in this kind of environment,
image might be more important than I
thought,
especially in leadership roles. Visual
credibility matters. People tend to
trust those who look like they know what
they're doing. It might sound
superficial,
but it's a very real part of
professional culture.
Interesting. So, it's not just about the
clothes, but how they frame you as a
person.
Exactly. And the right clothes can help
you feel more prepared.
That inner shift in posture, tone,
energy. It all starts with how you see
yourself.
That's the psychology of appearance.
Okay, now you've got me thinking. I'll
need pants, shirts, and maybe a couple
of jackets. Nothing too crazy.
but enough to get me through the first
few weeks.
Perfect. I'll set up a few combinations
for you to try.
One more thing, don't forget the power
of accessories.
A watch, belt, and shoes that match can
elevate your whole look. You've got me
convinced, man. I didn't know there was
this much behind choosing a shirt.
That's why I'm here to guide you. You're
not just buying clothes. You're
investing in presents.
I'll take these pants, two bottomups,
that navy blazer, and the brown shoes.
And yeah, throw in that belt, too.
Great choices. You're going to walk into
that office looking sharp, capable, and
ready to lead.
Thanks, Nicholas. Honestly, I came in
thinking clothes didn't matter much, but
now I see that image is part of success.
You got it. You only get one first
impression.
Now you're going to own it.
All right, let's explore the seven
advanced and essential phrases from the
conversation.
These are powerful expressions you can
use in real life to sound more fluent
and clear. We will see the meaning, two
examples, and pronunciation.
Number one, low key,
simple, not flashy, modest in style or
behavior.
For example, I prefer a low key dinner
with friends instead of a big party.
Example two, her outfit was low key, but
he still looked very elegant.
Now repeat after me. Low key.
Low key.
Number two, the style is a language.
The meaning is your appearance sends a
message just like your words do.
For example, he walked into the meeting
in a sharp suit. His style was saying,
"I'm in charge."
Example two. Style is a language and
today I want mine to say I'm confident
and creative.
Now repeat after me.
Style is a language.
Style is a language.
Number three, versatile.
The meaning is able to be used in many
different ways or situations.
For example,
a white shirt is versatile. You can wear
it to the office or a casual dinner.
Example two. This jacket is versatile
enough to
This jacket is versatile enough to dress
up or down depending on the occasion.
Now repeat after me. Versatile.
Versatile.
Number four. Pretentious.
The meaning is trying to seem more
important, talented or cultured than you
really are. Showy.
For example, he decorated his apartment
in a very pretentious way full of gold
status.
Example two. I don't want to look
pretentious,
just professional and clean.
Now repeat after me. Pretentious.
Pretentious.
Number five, intentional.
The meaning is don't on purpose with
thought or planning. For example, her
makeup was simple but intentional. It
showed she cared.
Example two, wearing a blazer to your
interview is an intentional move to look
professional.
Now repeat after me.
Intentional.
Intentional.
Number six, visual credibility.
The meaning is the idea that your
appearance can make people trust or
respect you more.
For example,
a tidy appearance gives you visual
credibility in professional settings.
Example two, first impressions are about
visual credibility.
People trust what they see.
Now repeat after me.
Visual credibility.
Visual credibility.
Number seven, psychology of appearance.
The meaning is the mental and emotional
impact of how we look and dress.
For example, the psychology of
appearance shows that when we dress
well, we feel more confident.
Example two, he studies the psychology
of appearance to help clients improve
their selfimage.
Now repeat after me. Psychology of
appearance.
Psychology of appearance.
Well done. Now, shadowing section.
Repeat each phrase after a short pulse,
trying to match the rhythm,
pronunciation, and intonation.
Do this two to three times for each
sentence to train your mouth and ears in
real English flow.
I like to keep things low key.
Remember, style is a language and the
goal is to send the right message.
Let me show you some basics. A well
fitted navy blazer, for instance, is
extremely versatile.
Clean lines, solid colors, nothing that
feels pretentious.
Looking sharp isn't pretentious.
It's intentional.
It tells people you care.
especially
in leadership roles. Visual credibility
matters.
That's the psychology of appearance.
Excellent.
Now you will answer three questions
about the conversation.
You will be given some seconds to answer
the question and then I will give you
the answer. I recommend you to repeat
the conversation part again before you
go to this section. Remember these
questions are comprehension questions
and sometimes there is not an exact
answer but the main idea.
Let's start.
Number one, why does Stean want to go
shopping?
The answer is because he was just hired
at a new company and wants to look more
professional to make a good first
impression.
Number two, what does Nicolas say about
first impressions and clothing?
The answer is
Nicholas says that your outfit speaks
before you do and that looking sharp
sends a message of confidence and
reliability.
He believes in the importance of visual
credibility.
Number three, what lesson does Stean
learn by the end of the conversation?
The answer is Stean learns that how you
dress affects how others see you and how
you see yourself. He realizes that image
is part of success and that being
intentional with your style matters.
Great job everyone. You've just

Bye for now.
Okay class, today I don't want to talk about 
grammar. I don't want to talk about tests. I  
want to talk about something real. I want to 
talk about fear. Let me ask you all something.  
How many of you are scared to speak English? Be 
honest. There's no shame here. Raise your hand  
if you feel scared. Thank you. It's okay to feel 
that way. Fear is something many students feel,  
but they don't always say it. Today, I want us 
to share our stories. When did you feel afraid  
to speak in English? Why were you scared? What 
happened? I promise you this is a safe place. I  
can start. Mr. Adams, I still remember the first 
time I had to speak in English in public. It was  
2 years ago. I was at a coffee shop and there was 
this American tourist who asked me for directions.  
I understood him perfectly. I knew where he 
wanted to go. I knew the words. But my heart  
started beating so fast. My hands started to 
sweat. I froze. I couldn't say anything. My mind  
went blank. I just pointed and said, "There." It 
was so simple, but I was shaking. After he left,  
I felt terrible. I kept thinking, why couldn't 
I speak? Why was I so afraid? Thank you, Daniel,  
for sharing that. I know that feeling. 
It's very real. You know what happened?  
It wasn't your English that failed you. It was 
your fear. Fear can make your mind freeze. But  
here's what you can do next time. Slow down. Take 
one breath before you answer. Many people try to  
answer too quickly because they feel pressure. But 
you can take your time. When your heart is racing,  
your brain can't work well. One slow breath can 
make a big difference. Also, remember the person  
talking to you is not your enemy. Most people are 
patient if you stay calm. I wish I had known that  
then. I always thought I had to speak fast to 
sound good. Fast English is not better English.  
Calm English is better English. Mr. Adams, I had 
a similar experience, but mine was worse. I was in  
a job interview. It was for a very good company. 
I studied the vocabulary. I prepared my answers.  
I even practiced with my brother. But when I sat 
in the interview room and the manager asked me in  
English, "Tell me about yourself, I just forgot 
everything." I could feel my face getting hot.  
I knew the words, but my mouth didn't move. I 
said one sentence, but then I stopped. I said,  
"Sorry, I don't know how to say this." And 
I just wanted to disappear. After that,  
I couldn't get the job. I felt like I 
failed. Thank you for being so brave, Louis.  
I know that must have been very painful, but 
you didn't fail. You had a difficult moment.  
It happens. You know, job interviews are one of 
the most stressful situations, even for native  
speakers. They make everyone nervous. Here's my 
advice for you. When you prepare for an interview,  
don't memorize long sentences. Prepare keywords. 
Prepare little pieces you can connect. When you  
try to memorize everything, your brain can panic 
if you forget just one word. But if you remember  
key ideas, you can build your answer step by step. 
Also practice speaking under pressure. You can ask  
a friend to make you nervous on purpose. This 
helps you learn how to breathe and speak when  
you are stressed. I never thought about practicing 
the pressure. I always practiced alone. Very calm.  
Exactly. But life is not always calm. You need 
to practice feeling nervous so that when the  
real moment comes, your brain knows what to do. 
That makes sense. It's not just about the words.  
It's about how we feel. Yes. Speaking English is 
not only about grammar. It's also about courage.  
Fear makes us small, but when we talk about it, we 
take away some of its power. Thank you, Mr. Adams.  
I always thought I was the only one who felt this 
way. You are not alone. Many people feel the same,  
even if they never say it. That's why we're 
talking about it today. And you're both already  
stronger because you shared your stories. Thank 
you again, Daniel and Louis. You were both very  
brave to tell your stories. Now, is there anyone 
else who would like to share? Remember, this is  
a safe place. We are here to help each other. 
I can share, Mr. Adams. I didn't want to talk,  
but now I think it's important. My story happened 
last summer. My family went to visit some friends  
from Canada. They don't speak our language, 
only English. At dinner, they asked me questions  
about the school and my hobbies, but I couldn't 
answer. I was so scared to make mistakes in front  
of everyone. I just smiled and said it's okay to 
everything. I laughed at the wrong moments because  
I didn't know what to say. I felt so small, so 
stupid. After dinner, I went to my room and cried.  
I felt like I was not good enough to speak English 
since that day. I always feel afraid when I meet  
English speakers. Thank you, Javier. I'm really 
proud of you for sharing that. I know that was  
very painful and I want you to know you are never 
stupid. You were just a friend. That's very human.  
Many people feel the same when they have to speak 
in front of others, especially native speakers.  
You know what helps? You have to start with very 
small steps. For example, in situations like that,  
you can prepare three simple answers that you feel 
comfortable saying. I like sports. My favorite  
food is pizza. I go to high school. These are easy 
sentences that you can use quickly. When you start  
with small successes, your brain says, "Oh, I can 
do this." And when you feel comfortable, you can  
say more. It's not about being perfect. It's about 
being present and being part of the conversation.
But what if they laugh at my mistakes? That's 
a good question. The truth is most people don't  
laugh. And if someone does laugh, that's 
not your problem. That shows who they are,  
not who you are. You are learning a new language. 
That is something to respect. And remember this,  
you only get better when you try. Mistakes 
are not your enemy. They are your teachers.
I guess I never thought about it like that. 
I always felt I needed to speak perfectly  
or say nothing. Perfect English is not the 
goal. Communication is the goal. And you can  
communicate even with a small simple sentences. 
Start small, grow slowly and be kind to yourself.
Mr. Adams, I also want to share something. I 
always feel afraid to speak English in class,  
not just outside here too. I remember last month 
you asked me to read a sentence. It was a simple  
sentence, but when you called my name, my stomach 
hurt. My hands were cold. I was shaking. I tried  
to read, but my voice was shaking too. I was 
so embarrassed. After that, I was afraid to  
speak again in class. Even now, when I know the 
answer, I don't raise my hand because I'm scared  
I will speak wrong and everyone will look at me. 
Thank you for telling us, Diego. That is something  
I hear from many students. I know that feeling. 
It's called stage fright. The fear of speaking in  
front of people. It's very common and it happens 
in all languages even in your own. But you know  
what helps? Practice speaking in small groups, 
not in front of the whole class. Sometimes big  
groups can feel like a lot of eyes watching you. 
But if you practice in pairs or small groups, your  
brain starts to relax. It's like learning to swim 
in shallow water before going to the deep water.  
But what if I make mistakes in a small groups? 
That's even better. In a small groups, it's okay  
to make mistakes. In fact, you should try to make 
mistakes. That's how you learn. And also, Diego,  
you can practice reading out loud at home. Read to 
yourself in front of a mirror or record your voice  
on your phone. The more you hear your own voice in 
English, the more normal it will feel. I think I  
can try that. I always feel strange hearing my 
voice in English. Yes, but the more you do it,  
the more comfortable you will feel. You don't 
have to be perfect to be brave. And remember,  
in this classroom, nobody is laughing at you. We 
are a team. We are all learning together. Thank  
you, Mr. Adams. I always thought I was the only 
one who felt this way. Me too. It feels good to  
know we are not alone. Exactly. You are not alone. 
All of us have felt this fear. But the best way to  
beat fear is to face it slowly, step by step. 
And we will do that together in this class.  
Thank you for this talk today, Mr. Adams. I feel 
like I understand my fear more now. It's not just  
about English. It's about believing in myself. 
Yes, me too. I feel like now I have some tools  
to fight my fear. I'm proud of all of you. You 
were very brave to speak today. Fear is normal.  
Mistakes are normal. The important thing is 
never stop trying. Never stop speaking. You  
are stronger than your fear. And what about 
you guys? When did you feel afraid to speak  
English? Why were you scared? What happened? 
Tell us in the comments. Have an excellent day.

Hey bro, did you study for the
university exam tomorrow?
I heard it's going to be super hard.
We needed to study a lot for that exam.
Um, to be honest, no, I didn't study not
even one page.
Wait, what? Why not? Are you okay? Did
something happen?
Well, yes,
something happened, but it's not
serious.
It's just
I feel embarrassed to say it,
that's all.
embarrassed. Come on, man. We've been
friends for years. You can tell me
anything.
Okay. I didn't study because
I was on my phone the whole time.
I kept telling myself, "In a few
minutes, uh, I'll start studying.
But that moment never came.
Every time I looked at the time,
it was later and later and I was still
watching my phone that happened.
Oh man, I've been there too, but like
the whole day.
Yes, literally the whole day. I sat with
my books in front of me
and my phone next to me. Then I saw a
video that looked funny, so I watched
it.
After that another one started
automatically.
Then I
I saw some posts from my friends
parties, food, gym selfies, all that
stuff.
Then I saw news about a famous singer
and started reading comments.
Then I remembered a game I was playing
and I said, "Let me pass this level
real quick."
And even when I opened a video about
psychology,
our university major, I told myself,
"Well, at least it's related to my
career.
But still I didn't study.
I don't know what happened to me.
Wow. That's exactly how technology
addiction works.
You feel like
like you're doing something useful, but
in the end you're just losing time.
Yes, that's what I hate. I wasn't even
doing anything bad.
I wasn't partying or going out. I was
just sitting in my room looking at my
screen
for hours. And now I feel tired, lazy,
and even a little angry with myself.
Bro, I totally understand.
It happened to me last semester.
I had the same problem. I was always on
my phone. I couldn't stop scrolling.
social media, videos, news, games,
random websites. I was busy all day,
but I wasn't doing anything important.
I didn't feel happy. I just felt empty.
Yes. Uh-huh. That's the word, empty.
Yes. It's like
You don't even know why you're looking
at the phone. You just keep doing it.
Exactly. It's a kind of addiction.
People don't talk about it much, but
it's real.
Your brain gets used to fast
information.
Every video, every like,
every new comment gives your brain a
small reward. A little shot of dopamine.
Dopamine?
I don't understand. Like a a bad thing.
Well, it's a chemical in your brain that
makes you feel good.
For example,
the phone gives you small hits of
dopamine all the time.
That's why
it feels good to check it, but after a
while, your brain wants more and more of
it.
So what do you do? Well, you keep
checking
and checking
and your brain becomes addicted just
like with sugar or junk food or even
drugs.
Wow, I didn't know that. That sounds
really scary.
It is. And the worst part is that we
don't even notice. We think we are just
relaxing
or learning something. But in reality,
we are training our brain to lose focus.
That's why it's so hard to read a book
now or to study.
or even to have a long conversation,
our attention becomes very short.
Yes, that's happening to me. When I open
a book, I feel bored after two pages.
I want to check my phone again. It's
like my brain is saying, "Where is the
fun stuff?"
Exactly. And if we don't stop it now, it
gets worse. It can affect your memory,
your concentration,
your sleep, even your mood. Believe me,
some people start to feel sad or
depressed because they compare their
life to others
online
or they feel they are wasting time but
they can't stop.
I feel all of that. I feel asleepy all
day. Even if I sleep eight hours, I feel
like
like my brain is tired. And sometimes I
feel like I'm not good enough
because
I see people doing amazing things
online,
but I know it's not real life.
You're right.
Most of what we see online is fake or
exaggerated.
But our brain doesn't know that. But
listen, there's good news to
change this.
When I was going through this problem,
my parents gave me some good advice.
At first, I didn't want to listen, but
then I tried their ideas
and they actually helped.
So, I'll tell you what they told me.
Please do. I need help, man. I need to
change this situation now.
Okay, first they told me to create a
daily plan, a real schedule with time
blocks.
During the study time, I put my phone
far away like um in another room
or I give it to my sister and tell her
don't give this back to me until 10.
It works. Your brain starts to
understand. Now is a study time. Phone
comes later.
It's like training your mind.
Oh, now the second thing I did,
I turned off almost all notifications.
No vibration, no sound.
If something is urgent, people can call
me. Everything else can wait.
The notifications are a problem. Even
when I don't care about them, I still
check.
Right. And the third thing, I started
using a focus timer app. There are many
You choose what apps to block and for
how long. So I can't open YouTube,
Instagram, Facebook, Tik Tok or games
during my study time.
Wow, that would help me a lot because
even when I don't want to open those
apps,
I do it without thinking. I can't stop
doing that. Seriously,
exactly. This small changes help me feel
more free.
not from my phone,
but from the need to check it every 5
minutes.
And now I still use my phone,
but I use it after I finish my real
tasks and I enjoy it more. I feel like I
earned it.
That sounds so healthy, man. I think I
need to try all of that
because the way I'm living now, it's not
good. I don't feel happy anymore.
I feel like a zombie sometimes.
Alive, but not really living.
You'll see the difference in a few days.
More focus,
better asleep,
more peace in your mind, and guess what?
You'll feel proud of yourself.
Let's go study now. Even if it's just
for one hour, it's better than nothing.
Let's do it. And this time, my phone
stays in my backpack.

little more, please subscribe to the
channel and share this video with a
friend. Thank you very much for your
support.
Robert, you know, I've been thinking a
lot about work styles these days.
After the pandemic, so many people
started working from home. I tried it
for 6 months, but honestly, I really
didn't like it. I missed coming to the
office.
I feel much better working in person at
the office with people around me.
That's interesting, James, because I
feel the complete opposite.
I worked from home during the same time,
and for me, it was perfect.
I really enjoy online work.
I feel more comfortable, more focused.
And I save a lot of time and money
because I don't have to travel to the
office every day.
But don't you miss the energy at the
office?
For me, being in the same place with my
team makes me feel more motivated.
When I see people working around me, I
also work harder.
I feel more serious about my job. When I
worked from home, I felt distracted.
I wanted to watch TV or sleep. I didn't
feel professional.
I understand you, but for me, I feel
more productive at home. In the office,
sometimes there is too much noise.
People come to talk to me all the time
and I lose focus.
At home, I can create a quiet place. I
can concentrate better and I can finish
my work faster. I also feel happier
because I can manage my time.
But when you work online,
don't you feel lonely?
I like talking to my co-workers face to
face. I like going to lunch together. I
enjoy being part of a team that I can
see and hear. When I worked from home, I
felt isolated.
I only spoke to my cat.
Yes, that's true. Sometimes I miss
social moments,
but we can still talk online. We can use
video calls, chat apps, and even have
virtual coffee breaks.
Some of my friends work in fully remote
companies, and they say they have great
team spirit, even online. It's just
different, not worse.
I don't know, Robert.
I feel that in person work helps build
trust. When I see my manager every day,
I feel more connected.
I also learn better when I can ask
questions in person right away. When you
are online, sometimes people don't
answer quickly. It can feel slow and
less direct.
That's a good point.
But now with all the new tools, we can
work in real time, even from home. Apps
like Slack or Microsoft Teams help us
send fast messages. And video calls are
almost like being in the same room.
Also, when you work online, you can
organize your tasks better.
because you have more control of your
schedule.
But what about the home environment?
Many people don't have a good space at
home. Some people work in their beds or
in noisy houses.
The office gives everyone a clean,
quiet, and professional space.
I think that's really important.
That's true for some people, but
companies can help. Some companies now
give money to help workers create a good
home office. They sent chairs, desks,
and good headphones.
And you know, not everyone lives near
the office. Some of our co-workers spend
one or two hours traveling every day.
Working from home saves so much time.
Yes, the travel is a problem. I know
Sarah who spends almost 3 hours on the
bus every day. That's a lot of time
lost.
I agree. Working from home can help in
cases like that.
But don't you think working in the
office helps with career growth? When
managers see you every day, they
remember you. You get more
opportunities.
That's an interesting idea.
But things are changing now. Some big
companies now offer promotions to online
workers, too. They look at your results,
not where you work. And also, online
work allows people from different
countries to join the same team. That's
something we can't have in an office
job.
That's true. In an online job, you can
work with people from all over the
world. That's exciting. But what about
learning from others? In the office, I
can just ask the person next to me if I
need help. I can see how they work. That
helps me improve.
I agree that in-person learning is
faster sometimes.
But now we have online training, video
lessons, and group chats.
Some people say that online work helps
you become more independent.
You learn to solve problems on your own,
which is a very useful skill.
That's true. Being independent is a good
skill.
But sometimes I really like to feel part
of a big busy team. I like hearing the
phones ring. People talking, meetings
happening.
It makes me feel alive. At home,
everything feels too quiet.
I think it really depends on your
personality.
Some people like action and social
energy like you. Some people like peace
and quiet like me. I feel calm at home.
I can wear comfortable clothes. I can
play soft music while I work. I enjoy
that.
Yes, that's something I can't do at the
office.
But don't you worry about your health.
At home, some people don't move much. In
the office, I walk around. I go up and
down the stairs.
At home, some people sit for hours
without moving.
That's true. It's important to plan
exercise when you work from home. Some
people go for walks in the morning or do
a quick workout during the day.
Actually, I have more time for exercise
now because I don't waste time
traveling.
Good point.
I didn't think about that, but I still
believe that in-person work creates
stronger relationships.
I can make better friends at work when I
see people every day.
That can happen. But I also made online
friends when I worked remotely.
We had video games nights, online
lunches,
and we shared personal stories in our
group chats. It's possible, but it takes
more effort.
You know, Robert, this is such an
interesting topic. I think we don't talk
enough about it. In fact, I remember
when our company offered us to work from
home. Some people were so happy, but
others like me felt uncomfortable.
I like a structure. I like routine. When
I come to the office, I feel like I have
a clear start and end to my day. When I
worked from home, I felt like the work
never stopped. I worked in the morning,
at lunch, at night. It was hard to know
when to relax.
That's true, James. Some people say when
you work from home, it's easy to blur
the line between work and personal life.
You can start working too early or you
never stop checking your emails. But
that's why I always recommend creating a
clear boundary. When I work from home, I
always start at 900 a.m. and I always
stop at 6:00 p.m. I even close my laptop
and put it away so I don't see it. You
need to protect your free time.
That's a smart. I didn't do that. I kept
working and answering emails all night.
Maybe I didn't know how to set healthy
limits.
It's something we have to learn. I
remember our friend David. He worked
from home, but he didn't stop working.
He started feeling burned out. He was
always online, always saying yes to more
tasks. After some time, his health got
worse. He didn't sleep well. So, yes,
online work can be dangerous if you
don't protect your time.
Exactly.
That's what worries me. In the office,
we naturally finish at 6:00 p.m. and we
leave. But at home, work can follow you
everywhere.
Yes, but remember in person work also
has some serious problems.
Our coworker Julia for example,
she used to spend 3 hours a day in
traffic just to come here.
That's 15 hours a week just sitting in
the car. She told me it was exhausting.
When she started working from home, she
said she felt healthier, had more
energy, and finally had time for her
family.
That's a very good point. I remember
Julia telling me that travel time can
really damage people's quality of life.
You lose so much time and it makes your
days longer and more stressful.
Exactly. And don't forget the money. She
saved money on gas, on food, because she
cooked at home, and even on work
clothes.
Working online can really save a lot of
personal expenses.
Yes, the savings are real, but also the
office provides some things that we
don't have at home.
For example, when I'm here, the internet
is fast.
The printers are available. I have a big
desk, a comfortable chair, and all the
tools I need. Some people don't have
that at home.
True. Some homes don't have a good
working space,
but now companies are helping. For
example, I read that Google gives their
remote workers money to buy a good chair
at the desk and even helps pay for
better internet.
They understand that the work
environment at home is important.
Yes, I've heard that too. Still, I feel
I can concentrate better when I wear
formal clothes and I sit in a
professional space
at home. If I wear pajamas all day, I
feel too relaxed.
That's something I do carefully.
When I work from home, I always dress
like I'm going to the office.
I don't wear a suit, but I wear proper
clothes. So, I feel like it's work time.
It helps my mind focus.
I guess in the end, you really need
self-disipline to succeed in online
work. Some people work better with
freedom, but some people work better
with structure.
Exactly. For example, our company now
offers a hybrid system. Some people come
to the office two or three days a week
and work from home the rest of the time.
I think that's a perfect balance. You
get the benefits of both.
Yes, I really like that idea. Actually,
I've tried it this year. I come to the
office three days a week and I work from
home two days. It's nice because I see
people, but I also saved travel time
some days. I feel less stressed now.
I think many companies will move to this
hybrid model. It's good for everyone. It
saves money for the company, too,
because they can have smaller offices.
That's true. I read that some big
companies have closed some of their
buildings because they don't need so
much office space now.
Exactly. Another thing I like about
online work is flexibility.
When I work from home, I can start
earlier if I want or finish later.
Sometimes I can take a longer lunch if I
need to help my family. It gives me more
control of my life.
Yes, flexibility is very valuable.
Sometimes we forget that people have
children, family problems or personal
things to manage. Working from home
gives people more freedom to handle
those things.
Also, think about people who live in a
small towns or other countries. Before
they couldn't get good jobs because they
were too far, but now with online work,
they can join international companies
from anywhere.
It creates more opportunities for
everyone.
That's true. Online work can help people
in poor areas or small cities. get jobs
that they never had before.
Yes, it can really change lives,
but I agree with you that online work is
not perfect.
For example, it's harder to build
company culture. When we are in the
office, we have lunch together, we
laugh, we celebrate birthdays.
Online, it's harder to feel that family
connection.
Yes, that's what I miss. I feel that
when people work online, they sometimes
feel like strangers to each other. It's
hard to make deep connections.
That's true. But some companies now do
special things to build online culture.
For example, they have a virtual games,
online happy hours, and team building
activities.
It's not the same, but it helps.
I think it really depends on the company
and the people. Some teams can make
online work feel great, but some teams
don't know how to connect.
That's very true. And not every job can
be done from home. Some jobs need
physical presence like people working in
hospitals, factories or restaurants.
They can't work online.
Yes, we are lucky that our job gives us
that option. But I think in the future
more jobs will try to be flexible where
possible.
I agree. I think online work is here to
stay. Maybe not for everyone, but many
people will prefer it. And maybe the
best solution is to offer both options
